"**Commodity money**

Commodity money is money whose value comes from a commodity of which it is made. Commodity money consists of objects that have value in themselves (intrinsic value) as well as value in their use as money.

Example of commodities that have been used as mediums of exchange include gold, silver, copper, salt, peppercorns, tea, large stones (such as Rai stones), decorated belts, shells, alcohol, cigarettes, cannabis, silk, candy, nails, cocoa beans, cowries and barley. These items were sometimes used in a metric of perceived value in conjunction to one another, in various commodity valuation or price system economies.

"Whatever. Facebook and Ebay are not producing in the classical sense.

They merely have a very simple concept that makes certain processes more efficient than before (maintaining friend relations and ads), a concept not based on 'producing' anything but simply flowing from the rise of the internet. Somehow they won the race over competitors and their users are now 'producing' the content and generating traffic.

Now that they have big traffic income is generated from selling ad space. That doesn't make ad space their core business, that is not what they are 'producing'. That is a side effect or benefit.

They couldn't charge end user subscription fees because that's not how the internet works, look at e.g. news papers that do try keep paid sections, doesn't work, is very old timey, just like Bill Gates. So the business models revolves around ad income, but that is not their product; the core reason of their existence remains a social network and an ad site.

Reason why they have this huge traffic and thus ability to sell ads is because they disrupted previous conventions in their respective fields and added value by being more efficient and fast (I wanted to also say transparent but will leave that out with all the recent Facebook drama).

And my point (for the third time); this is very similar to crypto. 

Adding value, or being valuable, not because of 'producing' something, but because of removing inefficiecies and inequities (and being the first or best at it).

Your post asked to ""disprove the views of my big pals"". Munger said that crypto doesn't amount to anything because it ""doesn't produce anything"". I am refuting the need to 'produce' anything in the classical sense to become (tremendously) valuable.",1526019340

"This isn't surprising in my opinion. We have enjoyed an incredible rally in prices from the $!50 level to $19,000 in a few short years. Yet with prices clearly running into a strong resistance, miners are less likely to want to reinvest capital into mining equipment if they expect prices to keep falling substantially.

This period that we are in right now reminds me of a few months after the price surge up to $1,200 from the $60 level. The charts look almost identical, and if prices play out in a similar fashion this time as they did last time, then I am guessing we continue to see downward movements in price for the next year.

I know this is opposite of what is popular, and runs contrary to guys like Tom Lee, but, I think that we see prices of $3,000 before we see $30,000.

I obviously still believe in BTC in a huge way, and see it going to a million bucks per coin one day, but there is only so much growth that can occur in a certain amount of time, and I really think we have entered a consolidation phase which is going to require a lot of time for the markets to digest these prices.",1526018476

"I suspected that but was unsure.

So consider my scheme:

Before august 1st, 2017 I had my BTC on a PaperWallet, called “A”.

After august 1st I:
* Moved BTC from PaperWallet A to a brand new PaperWallet, called “B”.
* Used PaperWallet “A” now empty from BTC for Claim BCH.
* Parked BCH on Kraken.

Can I now move BCH to PaperWallet “B” and reunite everything there?
Out of native problems of PaperWallet (burn, flood, ...) there will be security problems?
My BTC-Side PaperWallet “B” is BIP38 encrypted, is ok for what said since now?

"&gt;Again, back to market cap. Look at market cap not dollar price when looking for investments. Stellar for example is 30 cents but is the 8th most expensive coin. For it to double it will need another $6.5b. I like stellar and what they’re doing not saying its a bad coin, but look at it like this. It was 1 cent in July, 2017. It peaked around 80 cents in January. That is a 80x for people who bought in July. Currently, stellar sits at 30 cents. If you buy in now, if it goes to 60 cents you get a 2x well the people who got in july get a 30x. STOP buying peoples tops, let the new noobs that come into crypto buy YOUR tops. You have to understand a lot of these guys that shill these high marketcap coins either got in really early, or are the suckers who bought the tops without realizing it.

I feel like you think you know what you're talking about, but...you have no idea what you are talking about. You clearly don't understand how market cap works as a metric. Market cap doesn't measure ""amount invested"" it measures: ( number of coins) x  (price). Depending upon liquidity, supply, and how the books are stacked up with orders, a coin could easily go from 1 billion market cap to 2 billion in with very little invested in terms of real cash.

"&gt; I'd agree, IF Bitcoin ABC were the overwhelmingly dominant client for the token in question, 

That's an argument that would work if Bitcoin Core was the *only* client. Since it's not, the argument doesn't work.

&gt; and the only one permitted to make any consensus rules changes.

Not really, no. Any client can make consensus rules changes. The rub is that they'll just fork themselves a new coin if they don't get the majority of the network to go along with them. Unless they do a soft fork, in which case they only *might* fork off.

It works exactly the same way in BCH land, by the way. Any client can attempt to implement a consensus change, but they need the agreement of the majority if they want to avoid making a new chain.

&gt; The fact is Bitcoin ABC is just one of 6+ independent clients for Bitcoin Cash (BCH). All of them are currently in consensus with regards to BCH protocol rules, but this can change at any time, and the community understands and accepts that this is the primary governance model prescribed by Satoshi Nakamoto in the white paper.

The fact is Bitcoin Core is just one of [6+ independent clients for Bitcoin \(BTC\)](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Clients). All of them are currently in consensus with regards to BTC protocol rules, but this can change at any time, and the community understands and accepts that this is the primary governance model prescribed by Satoshi Nakamoto in the white paper.

&gt; Saying ""Bitcoin Core"" is a useful and minimally offensive way to distinguish BTC now, from the chain that existed before SegWit activated and from BCH. In particular, it works because ""Bitcoin Core"" is the actual name of the dominant software repository for that fork branch.

This just circles back to the whole ""the client is called Bitcoin Core, the network is called Bitcoin"" thing. But hey, feel free to call it what you want; I can't stop you from being wrong.

Shit like this is why I generally stick to BCH and BTC. Simple. No confusion. No pointless back and forth about BCash and Corecoin and all the other similarly petty bullshit. Speaking of....

&gt; Or we could play /r/Bitcoin's game and devolve into calling it BCore or B-Fees at every possible opportunity and in every venue, and using an army of trolls and sock puppets.

I shouldn't have to point this out, but that's exactly what you're doing by trying to rebrand it Bitcoin Core (or any of the many other names /r/btc is fond of using). That's just as wrong as calling BCH BCash or BitcoinABC.",1526016639

"&gt; No other use case? Do you not think that's terribly ironic given that BTC is processing far more TXs than BCH? Hell, even Segwit alone is processing more TXs than BCH.

Nearly all of BTCs on chain txs are just people moving money to exchanges. What other use cases are there? You didn't name any. 

&gt; Wow, where have I heard this FUD before in the past 9 years? 

There was a point in time where this did not apply to bitcoin. It had genuine utility and a clear competitive advantage over alternatives. That's not true today and the BTC community is focused almost entirely on trading and trying to get rich rather than gaining merchant adoption and uses cases like they used to. Back then the ponzi label didn't apply. Today it pretty much does. 

&gt; I skimmed your article and didn't find ""mountains of empirical evidence,""
I mentioned one empirical study which ran on actual hardware in an actual network. There has been other academic research on scaling on chain as well. 

&gt; Lastly, I notice you still haven't addressed the elephant in the room, which is LN. How are big blocks better than using a layer 2 payment network like LN? &gt; How do big blocks compete in terms of speed, fees, resources or decentralization? If you can't answer this with good reasons then I'd say this debate is pretty much settled.

A month or so ago I set up a lnd node for the purpose of downing the channel graph. I wrote code (actually just reused a lot of code from lnd) to calculate the probability that any one node on the network with a given balance could find a route to send that balance to every other node on the network.... simulating a random user paying a random user. 

Obvious if a random Bitcoin Cash user tries to pay another than Bitcoin Cash user today it will go through 100% of the time. So what we're the results for LN?

For a $20 payment the route failure rate was 75%*
For a $100 payment the route failure rate was 100%*

*The failure rates will actually be higher than this in practice as I only check the total ""capacity"" of a route rather than if the capacity was correctly distributed along the route. Thus I only calculated the probability of finding a ""candidate route"". To see if the candidate route is viable you'd need to attempt the payment. 

Thus the actual failure rate will be even higher (possibly much higher) in practice. And of course, it's already way too high to be viable for payments. 

I also adjusted the channel graph giving each node 10x more capacity to see how that affects the results. Not much. A $20 payment still fails 42% of the time.  

This was entirely predictable as well. I wrote an article in 2015 arguing that it seems extremely unlikely that LN will work in practice. It seems like you'd have to drink some serious coolaid to actually believe the hype. 

Sadly it looks like you were one of them. Now you guys have to deal with the fact that you promoted something that is very quickly turning into a flop. ",1526015923

How does one disarm these 'attacks'?

From my point of view:

1. BCH is promoted in a fraudulent way by Roger and his employees. By referring to BCH as ""Bitcoin,"" he is misleading people to buy something other than what is most often referred to by this term, which is BTC.

2. Roger is himself a rather shady character, but is also in bed with the likes of *many* other scammers and bad actors. Of note would by CSW, McAfee and Jihan. 

3. BCH is naturally more prone to centralization and attacks than BTC because it has less hashing power, a larger block limit (though in reality much smaller blocks) and its development team is smaller and less diverse. (among other reasons)

"&gt; There is no such thing. 

Is that a joke? You realize that store of value is a fundamental property of sound money, right? 

&gt;What you call store of value is actually unsustainable speculation.

No that's not what I'm calling store of value. Nice strawman.


&gt;In order to provide a return commensurate with it's risks BTC must acquire a perceptually increasing number of new investors since it has not other use case. 

No other use case? Do you not think that's terribly ironic given that BTC is processing far more TXs than BCH? Hell, even Segwit alone is processing more TXs than BCH.

&gt;This is very similar to a ponzi scheme in that once the flow of new investors stops, there's nothing left to sustain the price.

Wow, where have I heard this FUD before in the past 9 years? Hmmm... (also, you don't address that BCH is in the same camp [but obviously much worse because of worse network effect, hashing power, volume and price])

&gt;Actually no we don't. As I've said on many occasions nearly every computer in use today has loads of excess capacity that the claim that people will need buy more expensive computers to process the chain, thus harming decentralization because fewer people will do it, is just flat wrong. Only a dogmatist would continue to hold this position against mountains of empirical evidence.

I skimmed your article and didn't find ""mountains of empirical evidence,"" I just saw the same tired excuses and justifications on why big blocks should work out (also your conception of big blocks is rather small, is it not?). I did like how you at least acknowledged the ""topping off blocks"" problem (a user here yesterday vehemently refused over and over to acknowledge this point). However, like I said, I'm unconvinced. The bottom line is that big blocks eat up resources and push nodes off the network. Furthermore, blocks would have to be absolutely enormous to compete with the likes of legacy systems on a global scale. Beyond that, the fee problem would be perpetual due to spam. Blocks will fill up, fees will go up and people will demand lower fees and even bigger blocks. This problem repeats ad nauseum. 

Lastly, I notice you *still* haven't addressed the elephant in the room, which is LN. How are big blocks better than using a layer 2 payment network like LN? How do big blocks compete in terms of speed, fees, resources or decentralization? If you can't answer this with good reasons then I'd say this debate is pretty much settled.

""". . .  BoA’s CTO Kathy Bessant said that cryptocurrencies are “designed to be not transparent” and thus hinder banks’ attempts to catch “bad guys . . . As a payment system, I think it's troubling, because the foundation of the banking system is on the transparency between the sender and the receiver, and cryptocurrency is designed to be nothing of the sort, in fact \[it's\] designed to be not transparent,” she told the program, "" The way we sort of quote\-unquote catch bad guys is by being transparent in the financial moment of money. Cryptos is the antithesis of that,” she added. 

Now this is quite interesting. I can accept that the BofA bans the purchase of stocks and currencies in general using their credit card. It's probably a good policy, because a lot of people would stack up debts they couldn't pay back. But her reasoning regarding cryptos to back up that policy is nonsense. Either she genuinely does not know that all Bitcoin transactions are public, or she does know and is simply lying, presumably to keep her bosses happy. Neither explanation is a good one. But also, think back to the long mortgage\-lending swindle that culminated in 2008. What was transparent about that? And who were the bad guys then?

No one cared about transaction speed or fees. We were not here to compete with centralized systems or being paypal 2.0

Then the rockefeller think tanks came out with the lame-stream narrative that bitcoin was some kind of 'digital asset' that you buy and sell with fiat to increase your fiat wealth. The last thing they want is for people to see it for what it is - a voluntary exit from the fraudulent debt based fake fiat money creation system.

At this point we were flooded with noobs wanting to get rich in dollar terms - the price went up.

Then came the 'block size debate'. This was started by people who had a massive amount of control over mining equipment and their JP Morgan backers as they saw a significant attack vector available to take over bitcoin. All kinds of shady stuff happened - bitcoin ABC, bitcoin unlimited etc.

This was THEIR game, been doing it for generations. Divide and conquer. The noobs, who were here to get fiat rich, were easy prey for this 'debate'. For the community, it was not a debate at all, we understood math. We understood that the people behind this attack vector were the corporations in the space, not US. They understood that by increasing block size, THEY would be able to run nodes, but the common man would not be able to. They could get centralized control. We didn't take it seriously at all. I mean, people can do simple math, right?

We were wrong. These new People can't do math. They listen to what they are told by social media misinformation tactics - also paid for by the banksters. They don't research. They don't understand what bitcoin is really about. They fall for catchy double speak like 'satoshi's vision' etc. they believe it is all about competing with paypal.

Th 'debate' was started here and many noobs were swayed. ALL of the attempts failed. They were crowding out the r/bitcoin sub with mountains of bullshit. It was no longer a place to go for tech information or the revolution that bitcoin is. This was also paid for by the banksters. All of us volunteers interested in building a war free future for our grand kids simply could not compete with thousands of paid shills filling the sub with bullshit. So the apparent 'censorship' was started.

It was started as a necessary response to this paid for attack on the place people went to for the real message of bitcoin. Then r/btc was started by these same people to propagate the 'debate', which really wasn't a 'debate' at all. We did the math, no debate.

It became a debate when we realized bitcoin was under attack by corporate and bankster forces.

A lot of Shenanigans ensued. Bitcoin ABC, bitcoin unlimited, closed source binaries etc.

The community was taken by surprise, in fact we were shocked. It was all so ludicrous.

None of the attacks succeeded. Bitcoin was robust. We were proud. Then we rejected - as a community - the corporate NYC 'agreement'. THAT is when bcash was born with the narrative that it is the true bitcoin vision/chain.

That didn't work either. Bitcoin is robust.

So, here we are now. We've got Bitcoin and we've got an alt coin - bcash, with it's associated centralization, lack of dev support problems, emergency non-consensus decision making from the bcash board, like the EDA (which simply would not be possible in a leaderless decentralized crypto). 

It's time your 'community' moved on into 2018. All this stuff has been over for months now - an eon in the crypto space. Get over it. Bitcoin is robust.

Now, r/btc exists ONLY to try to confuse noobs and ride on bitcoin's coat tails. Very lame and makes your entire community look like criminal ignorant fools that can't do math and missed the whole point of bitcoin. Meanwhile bitcoin adoption is up, the original message starting to poke through again.

There may still be a whiff of interest in bcash in Umerca, where people simply cannot think for themselves, but believe me, the rest of the world KNOWS bcash is the residual leftover of just another scammy, failed attempt to take over bitcoin by the banksters.",1526009070
"Yeah I agree with you on just about everything! Especially your last point about statelessness. Centralization will always inevitably be taken advantage of. But I would note that communism doesn't depend on centralization. It in fact is by definition stateless. That's what movements like Democratic Socialism are about. The idea is that the equivalent of ""companies"" in a democratic socialist society would be democratically organized in a similar way to that of a democratic country, where ""managers"" are elected by the workers and can be removed if they're a dick or something. In a system like that, you could say there is a state but it would just be a collective effort on the part of every person in the state acting together, so it would certainly not be a state in the modern sense (i.e. a structure to maintain the existing power structures and property rights). It'd basically be an extension of the Enlightenment Age transition to liberal democratic government, to the private sector. 


Also, communism is not a political system, it's an economic one. Communism can be implemented within different kinds of political systems, more or less fascism in most of the examples of communism we've seen in the real world, which is of course by definition not communism because with an extremely powerful state, you're not really stateless. Sorry Stalin.

But I'm very excited about how DLT can play into this narrative. I think that things like Bitcoin really blur the lines between seemingly diametricly opposed ideas. It's publicly owned and operated by the whole community as in socialism, but is fundementally governed by markets and market incentives as in capitalism. I imagine a system that blurs the lines even further and leverages blockchain tech to efficiently allocate resources in a decentralized way akin to a market, but instantly over the Internet with a consensus mechanism. That formed consensus could be considered the plan for a planned economy, which was developed dynamicly and globally in a decentralized way. Sounds a lot more efficient than markets, waiting for price signals to propogate and all that. Who the fuck knows.",1526009032

"I understand that the potential revenue is proportional to the stake, but profitability is a factor of an LN node's revenue. Even if there are big players, the entry barrier is low and almost everyone can run an LN node and collect fees. Of course, this is proportional to your stake, but which doesn't have to be huge, since LN is intended for micropayments mainly. There might be large transactions happen on the LN too, but the great  majority will be microtransactions, where nodes with a small stake can profit well. So there are multiple arguments against wealth redistribution to the unequal benefit of a few. There are much more profitable and better monopolization-able ways of making money in the Bitcoin industry. E.g. mining equipment manufacturing has way bigger issues with centralization and abuse of market power, especially when they protect their hardware with patents (e.g. ASICboost). Also buying a mining rig is lost money, while a stake is always refundable. ",1526008987

"Great paper actually, thank you. 

I would argue that POW is similar in practice, all bitcoin nodes first contact (centralized) bitcoin bootstrap servers first to start syncing the chain. Bitcoin-Core also has a few developer checkpoints in it for some reason. 

However it’s true that you can hold two competing bitcoin chains side by side and unarbitrarily determine which one is correct history &amp; which is the false-chain. 

But a meta-arguement would be that bitcoin only has value because people say it has value. Therefore you sync to the chain that people says has value, not (necessarily) the mathematically correct chain. For a PoS currency, you also sync to the chain with value, not the mathematically correct chain (because there isn’t one). 

Further, hashpower follows price, so BTC has the chain with most work, because it has the most value. So with this value first outlook, the above paper wouldn’t reduce the security guarantees of PoS coins. 

Also, determining is something does/doesn’t have value is definitely a form of distributed consensus. The “market value” of something is determined by all participants in the market ",1526006469

"I've read a lot into both sides of the argument and there are pros and cons. Bitcoin Core is more widely known and accepted as the real Bitcoin but mostly because it is what most exchanges offer as Bitcoin. Segwit and the Lightning network do actually make sense in my opinion and they do help with scaling issues. What I don't understand is why they didn't simply increase the block size before resorting to the lightning network. By increasing the block size, Bitcoin Cash is much truer to the original Bitcoin and really, increasing the block size would probably solve all scaling issues indefinitely. Moore's Law should allow technology to easily keep pace with huge block sizes if need be. 
Both currencies are good but in all honesty, I think this power struggle has kind of shot both of them in the foot and it is really unfortunate. The more they fight each, the faster competing coins will overtake them. Bitcoin, being the first coin, was always going to be slower to upgrade its tech but it's power came from having the biggest network. By forking and fighting, it weakened the network effect. 
As much as i would like to see Bitcoin Cash (or BTC) succeed, I am starting to think it's better just to go with another currency. Ethereum also has a strong network and has smart contracts and ICO's. Nano is free and almost instant. EOS has a lot of momentum. Cardano might become something. So many great newer coins that are simply better from a tech perspective, all they lack is a huge network (except Ethereum). ",1526004325

"&gt; Wow. Just Wow.

What?

&gt;Because people generally are scared that BCH is a scam because of the narrative of small block supporters.

Oh, come on, that's such a bullshit un-provable, falsifiable claim. Also, markets are supposed to correct for that. Where is the smart money that should be **pouring** in BCH right now if these prices are actually as cheap as you're making them out to be. Big players would be smart to accumulate a ton at these prices if what you're saying is true. Is there evidence they are? Not in the slightest.

&gt;They are. Bitpay add supports of BCH and thus enabling more merchants to adopt cryptos. Some shops in Japan prefer BCH more. The fact is, people are just not buying things with crypto that much because they still think cryptos are scams or because people are scared they can suffer a loss because cryptos are very volatile. Most of transactions that occur in blockchain are just between exchanges and wallets.

So merchants are adding and people aren't using? Then what's your point? Again, BCH transactions pale in comparison to BTC and BCH's whole marketing message is that it's supposed to be ready to go in terms of transactional capacity. Don't blame its failure to generate interest on peoples' skirmishness about crypto. If that were true then BTC transactions would be just as low.

"I'm from Venezuela and I actually did the math two or three weeks ago :)

It takes 81.634 btc to change every single Bolivar (Venezuelan devaluated currency) to bitcoin at black market rate (Then 700.000 bolivar/USD, now around 850.000 bolivar/USD), of course, you don't need to change every single bolivar, the whole point will be spark the use of bitcoin for every day use.

Right now, some people are asking for payment in USD in their US bank accounts. So, if I want to buy a car from you, I pay you 1.000 $ from my USD bank account to your USD bank account, the money never entering the country, but the transaction taking place. The goverment can't tax this or doing anything about it. This started with big stuff (Cars, real estate, rent) but now due to hyperinflation people are doing it for small stuff (I heard gym trainers asking to be paid on USD!). People are really smart when they need to go around goverment regulations.

So, what do you try to achieve? Hyperbitcoinization in one country. The goal will be to have people transacting on bitcoin instead of bolivares for most every day stuff. The goverment couldn't tax this and most important, it will give people some kind of stability (Bitcoin can go up and down, but bolivar will only go down).

So, if somebody is willing to sacrifice say 1.000 btc and receive worthless bolivares with the goal of sparking the use of btc for daily transaction, people will gain interest, demand payment to be made in bitcoin (Some people get bonuses on USD, but most of the population can't as they don't have an US bank account ... no issue getting a bitcoin wallet though) and people will start changing THEIR worthless bolivares to btc. This process will end up with people not taking bolivares and only accepting btc, the bolivar going completely worthless (no one wiling to buy it or receive it) therefore removing the power of the goverment on economic issues and the ability to print money out of thin air to pay for stuff (and destroying any ability to save).

I believe that if this happened, it will lead to regime change. The government is broke and can only pay for stuff by printing worthless money. The government will be unable to buy BTC (as is broke) and mass resignation will come from the military, ministries, and every mid and low goverment ranks (people won't be willing to work for worthless bolivares and the goverment won't be able to pay on btc). This will led to a goverment unable to exercise power and crumbling apart.

A man can dream, right? :)",1526001202
"This is a valid point, one I have thought about quite a bit. I personally am attracted to this kind of stuff mainly because I'm a tech geek who thinks it is cool (my holdings aren't even very big) and this is a place where it may fall off.

"&gt;  BTC's tx volume is purely the result of incumbency. Everyone knows this. 

That doesn't make much sense given that BCH shares the coin distribution prior to Aug 1. BCH is just as old as BTC. Almost 10 years old at this point. Furthermore, the exchange infrastructure is built up around BCH now and has been for quite some time. Yet we're still seeing a wide discrepancy in price and utilization between the two projects (about 5x-15x less). Why is BCH so far behind if it shared the network effect up until Aug 1 and is supposedly better tech/network? 

Also, ""everybody knows this""? Apparently not, otherwise people would be buying up cheap BCH like crazy. 

&gt;If the role was reversed and Bitcoin has 32 mb blocks and the Core devs forked off to choke off the chain and force $100 fees, that chain would be basically worthless.

This is a bad comparison. The actual situation is that one coin wants to scale using chain upgrades, abstracted layers and conservative (consensus-based) upgrades to the block size limit. The other wants to haphazardly jack up the block limit even when blocks are under Kb for no other reason except ""Satoshi's Vision"" and marketing to merchants and users (which has been a complete failure). 

&gt;Cryptocurrencies as a whole (including BTC) have next to no actual adoption. The number one use case is moving coins from a local wallet to an exchange to engage in speculative trading. Unless that changes, no coin will experience any significant transaction volume.

Bitcoin has store of value use case because of the strength and integrity of its network (i.e. confidence in its immutability and censorship resistance based on its ability to remain decentralized). No other coin has as strong a strong network and most are just centralized pieces of shit.

&gt;All we can do in BCH is ensure that the software isn't what is preventing it from happening.

Except that you sacrifice decentralization in order to jack up block size. There's no chance in hell that BCH remains at all decentralized if its plan is to scale to 8 billion people on chain.",1526000775
"bitcoin was literally created out of the 2008 financial crisis. This whole scene, what you're doing, learning about, came from this vision, this technology has a purpose, it was to give back power to the people.

Just makes you look stupid. If Bytecoin is a “scam” as you say, why hasn’t it been executed. 80% of a 500 million market cap dump is not enough for the developers to exit? It might be a shitcoin with a lot of shot going on (similar to XVG) but it isn’t a so called “scam”. This as well is a simplification for stupid people like you. If you can’t handle the risk of the market falling 2% because it turns out that a Top 20 coin was exit scammed, you shouldn’t be in crypto.

"But it's not a stock market... at all. And it's essentially uncorrelated to any other market, other than with regard to general market liquidity.

I agree most investors are here for returns - human beings are greedy bastards. But people can be in it for both tech and returns, and there are certainly those who care more about the tech, even if they're a minority.

You actually do have to understand blockchain and how it functions, in order to full grasp the growth potential it has... asking their opinion or assuming they know anything about the space is akin to going to the most preeminent basketball announcer, and asking them to cover a game of baseball with zero knowledge about that separate sport. Sure, maybe they will speak about how the game plays out, but they will not grasp the minute details of the sport, or be familiar with any of its significant or important players.

Again, it does actually matter lol. Crypto is not a traditional market, no matter how badly you want to believe that. This is precisely why Buffett (please spell the dude's name right if you want to praise him) missed out on Amazon and other key players. If you can't understand tech that alters the way the world operates, you will not realize its potential for future growth. You don't have to understand coding... but you better believe most investors grasp that Facebook and Google fundamentally altered the way we produce, share, procure, and disseminate information. (And early investors saw that these platforms had the potential to do so). 

Buffett and Co. do not understand this, and they don't understand how blockchain tech could further our society's methods of interaction.",1525998212

Yes. There's no freedom of commerce in Venezuela. For example, you cannot buy and sell bread, at a value that you choose. The cost and even the production quotes are defined by the Nicolas Maduro government.

It doesn't work like that. 800 BTC is nothing. If such news is true, it probably was in the black-market, in order to transfer value to other countries. It is very difficult to transfer US Dollars to other countries, without heavy taxes behind applied (if it is possible at all).

"Ive always thought of it in the way that.. Not one voice is stronger than the other \- no matter holding size. In determining the future of Bitcoin for people. It's not a currency controlling other assets/currencies to do something a certain way like Gold in a bank which turned into a blackmagicmoneymachine. 

Bitcoin is fueling a free market in a true capitalist sense. But allowing for that Capital ecosystem to act as everyones right to live in a world where your currency wants mankind to prosper and heal with this planet. It wants to help the guy labouring off at the bottom. Not profit off of him as a primary goal. But instead valuing what he, as a building\-block in a business represents. And rather, help him into his true form and potential to make it extra profitable.. A market that wants that. Well no such market has ever existed. A market that on many fronts promotes unity and a sense of community Rather than just making money off of Bitcoin. Or making a parallel of todays capitalist system \- Maximizing profits at any costs for as long as you can until BOOM market crash \- and then profit off of the bloodbath you created. Sucking in the blood of the people taking care of their families \- Providing and feeding into the very system that is killing him. Or to put it lightly. Living in a instant gratification, ineffective, financially and environmentally non\-sustainable system that is collapsing as we know it. Because Hulk need substance to guide life not shallowness. grumph. 

So if there is a poor distribution of the wealth in Bitcoin \- which there is. The answer in my mind is \- Only holding Bitcoin will not make you the richest anyway. But this/these individuals, only holding a huge amount of Digital Gold Money certainly have a large responsibility in creating a good future and not a bad one. One that I myself have investment opportunities for in the future. And id say they are smart because Bitcoin is probably the safest asset to invest in today. But that's jsut me. Bitcoin is the grandaddy that everyone wants there and loves tbh. And I don't even have one yet. But I will soon enough.

But in the grand scheme of things in any sense. Who is to say that Digital Gold \- is like physical gold?In the end. Digital Gold is just one BigPapaApp amongst a vast, dare I say, creatively infinite amount of resources in the universe for this market to capitalize and sustainabalize on. Legalize it.

However.. Without a sustainable revolution we are not going to Mars though. I can tell you that much.

"You sound like you’re a pretty smart person. You’re obviously taking some hits on here, but that’s just due to the fact we have all types of folks on here, and many love to express theirs, aggressively. 

Do I think governments will allow Bitcoin to become a one world currency? No. 

Keep in mind, just because these billionaires speak out against crypto, doesn’t mean they’re not involved. Jamie Dimon ripped bitcoin to pieces just a few short months ago, yet at the same time his company was filing patents about trading bitcoin with institutional money. Bill Gates rips crypto, yet Microsoft is partnered with Ripple to develop Mojo Loop. Buffet rips crypto, yet he’s invested in large banks, who are also partnering with Ripple to solve cross border payment issues. 

I believe Ripples XRP will be the bridge asset that allows businesses, banks, FI’s and any large mover of money cross borders to solve the pain staking expensive current process of transferring 50 million USD to Japans YEN in a matter of seconds, anytime, any day. Bank in US would purchase 50 million in XRP and send it to bank in Japan, and convert in to 50 million USD in the YEN. All in just a few seconds, and at a savings of up to 70%! 

Plus, this can be done in many many different currencies, to many different countries, and it’s just the beginning. 

I know many folks will disagree with this, and they are either XRP lovers or haters, but I suggest you spend one day of your time researching XRP and what types of problems it’s going to solve, and make your own decision. I could be wrong, but I believe they just might be making a huge announcement next week(but I don’t have proof) about companies moving forward with XRP. BIG companies. 

Just my opinion. Wish you the best!! ",1525996493
"&gt; Because merchant adoption becomes stagnant because primarily of fees. Steam and Microsoft are some examples. Big block supporters compromised. A lot. Some from 20MB. Some from 8MB. We reached 90% miners consensus on segwit2x but because of vocal minority that exist in r/bitcoin and heavily moderated forums, the voice of big blockers are silenced.

Again, this makes no sense. I'm not going to get into the whole segwit2x fiasco but the bottom line is *if what you're saying is true* then BCH would have tons of use right now. If small blocks were the thing that was holding back Bitcoin then Microsoft, Steam and the entire ecosystem would switch over to BCH and we'd see actual use. Instead, BCH blocks are ridiculously tiny (around the size of BTC way back in 2013) and there's absolutely no organic demand to buy or use it. So apparently BCH proponents were wrong about what the adoption issue is. 

&gt;One of the ways to increase the network is merchant adoptions.

That's a very small way, at least at this point in time. Nobody really cares all that much about buying coffee with crypto when then can just use plastic. Have you even looked into the use rate at Microsoft and Steam? It's miniscule compared to the trading and speculating (and dark web).

&gt;Take yours.org for example. Because of the complexity of lightning network, they abandon their code that use lightning network and diverted their resources to focus on BCH. We don't know how many other use cases are restricted because of the complexity of lightning network.

Ah, nice. An anecdote from a stupid site that's in Ver's pocket. Great example...

&gt;About the merchant adopting lighting network, maybe as you say, it is very simple, similar to adopting bitcoin. But what about other use cases like I mentioned?

What are you talking about?? What other use cases? The only use case you've brought up is merchant adoption. LN is so much fucking better than transacting on big blocks for merchants. It's easier, **instant** and fees are unbelievably small. What other use case are you referring to? So far that's all I've seen is ""merchant adoption"". 

All of this goes without even getting into the details of chain integrity and store of value properties related to that. Like I said, BCH is much weaker than BTC in terms of security and network effect. Therefore it doesn't compete store of value. Add extremely fast, cheap and extensive payment network (LN) and BCH becomes completely irrelevant (it's already basically irrelevant).

If you disagree with this you need to explain a. why BCH has such small blocks and little adoption, even after almost a year. Why aren't merchants flocking to BCH? and b. In what way are big blocks better than LN?",1525996391

Because merchant adoption becomes stagnant because primarily of fees. Steam and Microsoft are some examples. Big block supporters compromised. A lot. Some from 20MB. Some from 8MB.

One of the ways to increase the network is merchant adoptions. But other ways is finding use cases that is not just about merchants and customers. Take yours.org for example. Because of the complexity of lightning network, they abandon their code that use lightning network and diverted their resources to focus on BCH.

No it's not. Certainly not from an end user perspective. It works just like a normal wallet.

&gt;Merchants who want to adopt lightning network with their existing infrastructure can't do so without spending huge resources.

What is this merchant complexity that you're talking about? It's not hard at all to get a beta client set up and once wallets and clients are out of beta it'll be even easier. It's as simple as installing an application. Why do you keep referring to it as complex? It's really not.

"I already answered the question.

Bitcoin (BTC) is synonymous with ""Bitcoin Core"" because ""Bitcoin Core"" is the reference implementation that defines the ""BTC"" protocol.  It has a centralized dev team.  Any changes to the protocol are permissioned by that dev team.

Bitcoin ABC is not a reference implementation.  BCH doesn't have a reference implementation.  Fully 1/3 of BCH nodes are Bitcoin Unlimited.   There are at least two other development teams with full node implementations who participate in active protocol development.  There is not a permissions owner for the protocol, as there is in BTC.

""Bitcoin"" as a unified change ceased to exist when the SW2X trojan horse locked in, guaranteeing Segwit activation without 2X activation, causing large-blockers to finally exit in despair and create BCH as a full-fork of the blockchain to preserve it without Segwit and scale it as originally intended.

Do you also use sticks to make fire? Request Network is what you would use to make purchases from ebay etc not Bitcoin. Youd also just atomic swap via Lightning Network to Request. Google it, I dont care to explain.

&gt;Bitcoin can be lost under any number of scenarios: lost private key, lost/stolen/destroyed offline wallet, malware installed on your computer, hacks of exchanges, etc.

If you have a wad of cash on you and go mountain climbing and it falls out of your pocket, im sorry you did that. However, logical individuals do not do this with their bitcoin private keys. Youre trying to apply a banking concept to bitcoin private keys, not how it works dumb dumb.

If malware steals your banking creds, you might not get that money back either. See my above posts. Google some more if youre interested. Im glad your bank is amazing, but we arent talking about you.

&gt;Everything else is covered and you can get your money back if it's stolen from you.

No its not. See above. youre lying.

"Bitcoin Cash is similar to Bitcoin technology wise. Both have a limit of 21 Million Units, Both currently use SHA256 for mining, and both are fairly decentralized, Bitcoin Cash has about 11 to 14 percent of the hashing power of the current Bitcoin network.  It does not have segregated witness like Bitcoin \(depending on who you talk to that is either a good or a bad\). It has an 8MB block limit vs 1MB block limit \(not to be confused with the current block sizes, currently the average for the past 30 days is 50Kb\(Bitcoin Cash\) and 750Kb\(Bitcoin\) Both of these fluctuate\).

I think the main reason that Bitcoin Cash exists to begin with and the main difference between them is one is attempting to scale onchain, the other is attempting to scale offchain.  My bias \(since everyone has one\) is that Bitcoin Cash is better because if the block size average increased it would be able to handle the increased load without massively increasing the fees that had to be paid to get into a block.  If everyone used lightning this would be less of a concern but so far I wouldn't trust lightning with anything more than a few dollars, that however is a completely different subject that I would have to write another post on, however more information on it can be found \[here\]\([https://lightning.network/lightning\-network\-paper.pdf](https://lightning.network/lightning-network-paper.pdf)\).

Further block size increases will put a strain on older hardware if transactions increased to the amount visa processes, but I think hardware will have improved by the time the network reaches anything near that level and it will continue to function.",1525992936

"If anyone other than Core had a say in the consensus rules the developers are allowed to change I'd agree with you. 

The fact that Core insisted you could not make the 1MB user configurable, rather inserting themselves as the guardians of the 1MB limit, I've concluded the bitcoin network has fallen to centralized control. 

Naming the network after those who control the consensus rules is not disingenuous.  I'm honest with the reality, the methods they use are up for debatable, but in the end, the process results in the reference implementation that is called Bitcoin Core and it controls the BTC network. 

Even bitcoin.org accolade Bitcoin Core as the only core of bitcoin with this link: https://bitcoin.org/en/bitcoin-core/ note how other implementations like BU, ABC, XT and the others are not represented just the one.",1525992768

"It seems that people on either side of the argument are conflating Bitcoin, bitcoin, blockchain, and cryptocurrencies.   
Those terms are not interchangeable, people seem to use them interchangeably in order to further their own narrative.   

So let's get this straight, bitcoin is not going to be used as a replacement currency as ""feared"" by Belfort because majority of people who have or deal with it, they use it as an speculative asset to hold worth.    
Bitcoin is a new type of asset, it does not have the traditional properties that an asset would normally have. Sure it does not produce anything and without participants it really is worthless.   
However its value real albeit fragile, it is driven by hype, fomo and hope. Sure those are not traditional and they a fickle at best, but that is what drives the value up or down. That is why bitcoin and other cryptos are so susceptible to FUD, cryptos that are not affected by FUD have tangible purpose and use.    

There will be at the very least a handful of cryptos that will be used in parallel or as an alternative to traditional currency , it will not be bitcoin nor ether they are no longer functional as currencies.    

So, point is. Bitcoin is not the only crypto that needs to be taken into account, specially when talking about ""a functional currency"".     
So yes governments will not ""allow"" bitcoin to be ""mass adopted"" as a currency, but that is because it use and use case is **not** as a currency.   
So not so much not allowing but they will not have to. Bitcoin is used to store value, so it will be heavily regulated and controlled by governments but even that will not be for much to longer because other technology will take over, the only reason bitcoin still the talking point is **because it is the talking point**.

"I think it’s pretty simple

Bitcoin became expensive and slow due to the large number of transactions that the network was not designed to handle. 

A number of solutions were proposed to solve these major issues. Two solutions gained the most traction: core decided to implement segwit and continue developing lightning network, and bitcoin cash devs decided to raise the block size.

The bitcoin cash solution solved the problem immediately. Fees are low and transactions are fast. The bitcoin core solution kicked the can down the road in hopes that what is essentially a second layer solution would eventually solve the problem. Fees are still high (except when no one actually uses the network and the fees obviously go down) and the network is still slow (again, except when no one is using it).

To me there’s not much more to the story than that. Now there’s a ton of “this is the real bitcoin” talk and “this is the original vision” talk and all this crap that’s meaningless. 

The only thing that matters is which one works. Bitcoin cash works quickly and cheaply and can function at higher transaction throughput than bitcoin core in its current state. Therefore i find bitcoin cash to be the better of the two coins right now. If lightning network is ever fully introduced i will obviously reconsider based on the specifics of how it works but right now it’s not completed and there are a number of questions regarding whether it will actually solve the problem at hand.

"I've got a user experience report for you, hope it helps:

- I created a new wallet, and thought this process was similar to other bitcoin apps and intuitive/acceptable. On a side note, I'm sure you won't listen to this advice but I personally dislike the common procedure where wallet apps force users to take security precautions by making them write down the multi word seed and then type it back in. I think wallets should give people an option to be idiots: automatically prepare a text file for them with their seed words and open up the ""share"" screen so you can email it to themselves. I encourage you to embrace the idea of giving people the option to use terrible security if they are lazy idiots or just testers. We testers in particular don't like jumping through hoops when we're not going to keep this address or storing anything of value in it.

- I like that it gives you basic instructions with step by step buttons for how to get started. Also, I think there should be an option to get rid of this getting-started interface once you're done getting started. For someone who already has bitcoins in the app, they'll probably want their main screen to show them their lightning balance and give them tools to manage it, with a button to let them look at their onchain balance and manage that. (I also appreciate your decision to speak of these balances as a checking account and a savings account, which is quite intuitive, though I personally think we should gradually -- eventually -- get people used to referring to these things as addresses and wallets instead of accounts. For advanced users especially I think ""lightning balance"" and ""onchain balance"" are more appropriate descriptions than checking account and savings account.)

- Even though I like the basic instructions, they largely didn't work for me. The first step was to wait for syncing -- this was fine, though I noticed that when I got off wifi on my trip home and reconnected at home, the app got stuck syncing and I had to restart it. There's a possible bug somewhere in there.

- The next step was to receive test coins. I successfully and easily copy-pasted my pubkey into the field on the faucet page -- so far so good. The fields for channel amount and initial balance confused me -- I was like, ""My channel amount is currently zero. Is it asking how much I want to receive?"" But I typed in the number 100,000 because that's what was greyed out. Later I saw that there's an instruction in your app underneath the link to the faucet where you say to use a much larger amount -- I think that should come before they click the link, because I didn't see it until later and if I missed it, I'm sure other people will as well. Then with the second field I was like ""initial balance, that's obviously zero, because that's how much I'm starting out with."" But it wouldn't take zero as an option so I typed in the recommended one -- 50,000. I still don't know exactly what these fields mean, and confusion is not something you want for your users, so perhaps some more explanatory instructions would be advisable for this part. Anyway -- after getting amounts in there that the page's javascript error-correcter accepted as valid, I hit the submit button, whereupon the page tried to establish a connection to somewhere and timed out. I tried this repeatedly and it kept timing out -- I haven't yet gotten it to work, so that counts as a bad user experience. Likely user error -- but perhaps it is an opportunity for user-education on your part so that others don't have a bad user experience.

- I went down to the ""savings account"" card next and decided it might be good to get some testnet coins in another way. There are no instructions in your app for receiving testnet coins via an onchain, but I didn't really expect any instructions because that's not what this app is about and also I already know how. Getting those testnet coins into the app worked just fine though -- no problems there. 

- After I had some testnet coins in the app I tried to transfer them to my lightning balance (i.e. ""checking account""). I tried ""open channel to an existing peer"" because it sounded simple, but there seems to be a bug -- the screen turns white, a ""cancel"" button briefly appears but then goes away within a half of a second, and the interface remains completely white with no buttons or anything -- just empty white space from the top of the screen to the bottom. So I hit the back button, which unexpectedly minimized the app. After opening it again, I found myself at the homescreen. But I didn't need to resync, so I guess the daemon at least was still running in the background. Very poor user experience here. No matter how many times I try the ""Open channel to an existing peer"" button, that's what happens: white screen, brief appearance of a cancel button for half a second, then permanent white screen, until I hit back or home -- which then seems to restart the interface. Something's going wrong here obviously, but I'm not sure what.

- I decided to try to connect to a lightning node using the qr scanner, so I loaded up acinq's testnet explorer and scanned the qr codes of some well-connected nodes. I mostly kept getting an error message saying that they were not online (even for ones that I highly suspect Are in fact online, such as Endurance), but at least once I managed to find one that was online, but, alas, the attempt to establish a connection timed out, and the ""pending open channel count"" remained at zero. This is also a poor user experience and I was at it for about 10 minutes unsuccessfully.

- After all that I went into the ""show network graph nodes"" button and tried to connect to my peers in there. For a long time each peer said a connection could not be established -- and I even made sure I was fully synced by checking the message at the top of the app's homepage, which said I was synced -- but each peer still said a connection could not be made. After typing out most of this post I tried again and, lo and behold, connecting to those guys worked. This too is a poor user experience, though, because establishing these connections does not seem to have an obvious reason why it should not work for a long time and then suddenly work. And I still cannot move anything from my onchain balance to my lightning balance, nor does the faucet page work. So overall it's a very poor user experience, though your user interface is pretty good, and I like its helpful step by step instructions -- even if they didn't work for me and I think there should be a button to get rid of them once the setup is done.

I hope this explanation of my user experience is helpful in finding bugs and improving the app. I'm grateful for your efforts!",1525991183

"&gt; Don't think I've read about AMP before, seems interesting. I only read the mailing list entry and probably didn't understand it all, there doesn't seem to be much more about it that explains it any better. Can you explain it in an example?

The technical details are over my head but it essentially means that you can combine balances in multiple channels to make one payment. It's structured so that the recipient can't claim individual parts of the payment without all parts being successfully routed, so there's no chance of partial payment being taken by the recipient. 

&gt;To me it seems like all the paths used to send the shares still need to be connected to the person I want to pay, correct? And all paths still need to be made out of channels with enough funds. And the fees should be higher than in a more centralized big hub model (I saw the reduced fee claim discussed on the mailing list and it seems that AMP would actually be more expensive than a normal lightning tx for now, but maybe that can change in the future)



Why would fees be higher? Certainly they wouldn't be by any noticeable different. Fees on LN are extremely small (or free or even negative in some cases) and much smaller than even low-fee blockchain payments in the current environment (including on BCH).

&gt;What I also dont understand is that for this LN to work, we need block space. Not only for opening and closing channels, but to make sure there can't be a problem similar to a bank run where multiple channels close for whatever reason and transactions get stuck waiting to be mined.

You need a certain amount of blockspace, several orders of magnitude less than you would if you were transacting everything on chain. A competitive fee market would still exist on chain.

&gt;If we need big blocks eventually for LN, what were your points regarding BCHs problems with the propagation of big blocks? We haven't talked about that at all.

BCH takes a haphazard and unnecessary approach to scaling. Most BCH proponents deny that big blocks are problematic at all. They don't admit that there are centralizing trade-offs. BTC takes a conservative approach and will raise the block size when safe and necessary to do so. They do this alongside chain improvements like Segwit and Schnorr to make each MB as efficient as possible.

 
&gt;If we can live with most miners being big companies or rich people (from our ASIC discussion), can't we also assume that those entities have access to high quality internet connections, reducing the problem of big block propagation?

I can't live with that though. There's a point of no return where the network becomes too centralized and is no longer 'consensus' based and becomes mutable and censor-prone.

&gt;LN doesn't change anything about mining centralization, correct? Is there anything planned for this?

The plan is to not increase the block size haphazardly, which prevents mining from becoming overly centralized. So long as mining entities aren't able to capture the majority of the network (or close to majority), it should be okay. Ideally the more mining decentralization the better, but things will never be perfect. LN allows for scale without over-burdening the blockchain and supporting network.

&gt;There's a lot of stuff to read, think and talk about here in this discussion so it always takes me longer than I want to to reply :/

You're right in saying, that if we're dependant on news to be good, something is off. 



I think you can argue that value might currently simply exceed usecase. Yes, Bitcoin is being adopted as we speak, but is it worth that much already, when infrastructure is still being built? 


That however, also goes into price. Price is a crazy thing, isn't it? Lots of the value is already including that one day, we will have better infrastructure and the currency will be more widely known and adopted. 


Surely speculation will always be part of Bitcoin. However it possible that usecase vs speculation ratio is off.

Bitcoin was released in the midst of a global financial clusterfuck (GFC) and I've no doubt that many of those affected would have been better off with a portion of their wealth in bitcoin (you know, in addition to their suddenly worthless retirement funds etc). Such things wouldn't concern rich old men I guess.

A lot of people suffered due to the greed or ineptitude of others, and crypto removes such 3rd parties from the equation.

"You can check for instance [blockchain.info](https://blockchain.info) to view Bitmain's share of the hashrate on the Bitcoin \(BTC\) network \(antpool and btc.com\) \-\&gt; currently around 42&amp;#37;. So even on Bitcoin, Bitmain controls a very significant amount of hashpower. This company certainly is a centralising problem, but the competition is not sleeping and new producers and mining farms keep popping up.

I would guess bitmain controls the majority of the hashrate on Bitcoin Cash since they also own at least 2,5&amp;#37; of all BCH and are also burning parts of their mining fees \(presumably to increase the price.\)",1525988951

"How do you expect the ""6 different implementations"" people keep bragging about to stay in sync without implementing different protocol rules that create forks? How do you think they've been doing it so far? It's not by luck or by accident, it's that they got together and discussed which changes they wanted and agreed on a set and then they all implemented them. This is just formalizing that process.

Your ethereum examples don't really address the same question as this IMO. They are about how people *use* the protocol, and you're just pointing out that they're lazy and reuse other people's code. Well, welcome to open source development. You're not going to change human nature by intentionally fostering chaos, you're just going to create unintentional chain forks.

And BTW, of course no one will be beholden to this new organization. If they disagree they can fork off a different protocol, just like BCH did vs BTC (or vice versa, depending on your perspective). So there's still a ""permissionless"" environment if you want to. ",1525988726
"Bitcoin miners hold ALL the consensus power, but that consensus power is not centralized and it is dependent upon how efficient they are mining, it is pretty much agnostic whereas voting systems are corrupt and biased by definition.

&gt; I would argue that miners gaining an increasing amount of the limited supply of Bitcoin through transaction fees is an argument that Bitcoin only becomes more centralized over time. 

I don't know which notion of centralization you are using. Miners need to spend those coins, there is no use in hoarding them forever, they need to pay for their costs with the product of their work, being it block reward, fees or both.

On the other hand, a PoS system is basically a passive rewarding system where you don't need to spend any coins to remain in the game, it is the very definition of plutocracy, ",1525988582
"First, the cryptocurrency sub hates bitcoin. It's slow and drags down the value of every other coin.  2nd blockchain tech is being used in other tokens and coins that are not currency (utility tokens).

That is why I buy and use bitcoin. ",1525988366
No they won't allow it. Which is why crypto is so important - it removes them from the equation all together. ,1525988326
"So you expect not even thousands nor millions but billions of people in the global economy  world wide to adopt a currency where they can never be able to afford 1 bitcoin. What incentive does that have for people to want to even spend their bitcoins or use it as a currency in general if it just inflates to a value in which people will never be able to afford 1 bitcoin. Selling or trading a stack of 4 to 3 bitcoin could mean you’ll never be able to obtain 4 bitcoin again due to scarcity. A currency is one that can be readily used to exchange for good or services not one that is so limited people will only be able to use it in the smallest denominations. Being able to pay for things in pennies, nickles, and dimes wouldn’t justify the dollar being an absurd amount but denominations justify bitcoin being absurdly valued to the point no one can ever own 1?",1525988250
"No, he's saying Bitmain partially still mines Bitcoin, probably by supporting one of their pools. They do that to not end up being totally broke, if they do it at all, who knows. 


I wouldn't question however that BCH is controlled by him almost entirely. 


They're burning Bcash for example to artificially pump the price and he's great friends with Roger Ver and supports BCH on Twitter.  That's what we know. ",1525988246
I have been aware of this that’s why I haven’t traded BTC. ,1525988191
"1) The ethos of BCH is open development, letting it scale, and not negatively impacting user experience. If someone wants to port LN to BCH, make a twitter/facebook competitor, or implement tokenization there is nobody that can so 'no'.


2) Thinking that the best/most useful devs are only those currently involved in BTC and the rest of the people in the world are incompetent is simply naive. Considering the core devs are the cause for the BCH hardfork to occur in the first place it shows just how out of touch they are with the economic model of Bitcoin.


3) Looking at it from a network and hardware perspective I don't see how scaling onchain causes centralization of any concern. Yes some low-end nodes will become obsolete, and I'm totally fine with that - I don't expect a 20 year old modem to be able to handle todays internet speeds either.

You cant risk bugs on chains that are worth &gt;100B$, thats why everything needs to be tested thousand times and all sorts of problems need a specific Unit test. 


Newer projects tend to release code that isnt well tested, like also NANO or IOTA had network problems and outages for hours and days. Thats why they are faster with there releases, because it didnt really bother anyone if the network didnt work.

"I live in Europe and keep my “checking” at ING which is one of the largest banks around here. Have had lots of issues with others. Including Citi who ask me for $100k collateral to give me a $50k limit on a credit card and expect me to pay interest on what I use. And they’re not taking a piss, they really mean what they say. Go figure. You are lucky not to have with your bank the issues I have with mine. I literally have to carry cash around for situations where my cards or online banking error out or are under maintenance for hours in mid business day. Not that much of a big deal to my existence still, people have lived for thousands of years with bigger problems than mine but still, kind of annoys me when any simple question I have takes weeks to get answered and the simplest thing such as a card payment becomes soooo complicated. Not to mention the stupefied looks I get from tellers every 2 years when they demand copies of my paperwork (that expires once every 5 years) and I show them a passport instead of national ID, and I explain to them that I am an expat and I live in a different country, they act like I’ve shown them the birth cerificate of Thanos. Anyway, not a big deal like I said, just another minor should-I-laugh-or-should-I-feel-sorry-for-them moment.

Crypto is still a young platform, who knows what will happen in 10, 20, 50 years. It has some potential to disrupt the banking system though. I sure hope it does. For countless reasons.

Bottom line is I am just happy that a BTC payment takes 30 mins to “clear” as opposed to 3 business days for an international Swift payment. If I was to choose whom to hand a beer to, Satoshi Nakamoto or the IT manager at ING...you can probably guess who would get the beer and who would get the finger, regardless of their age, color or background or names they choose to call me. IDGAF.

I love everyone in the crypto community and I promise to help as much as I can. Maybe I will be lucky enough for my grand-grand-grandchildren to thank me one day and remember my name.

As far as I know, he invests in mostly smart contract blockchain related projects, but if you read between the lines I have a feeling his fund may have secretly bought BCH and just not talking about it publicly yet because he knows he will get thrown under the bus just for saying it out loud in this climate. 

In fact I think most crypto hedge funds are likely to have invested huge chunk of their funds in BCH at this point because the more you research this stuff, the more it becomes clear that the BCH vision is the most elegant of all. The only obstacle I see today is the ""brand"" simply because the vast majority of parrots have made it a popular trend to criticize ""BCash"" without thinking. But if one keeps an open mind, it's easy to see how each community is evolving. After all, people used to call Bitcoin a scam.

"Really happy to share this with you guys. It's just a short, but it was great fun making it. I was able to fully fund the film thanks to Ethereum.

We've already had some great press since releasing the trailer. The Next Web published a feature titled ​​”Buy the Dip is like ‘Silicon Valley’ for crypto nerds — but funnier” at https://thenextweb.com/hardfork/2018/04/04/cryptocurrency-comedy-show-buy-dip/ ​and I have been interviewed about the project by Bitcoinist Magazine and Cryptonews. 

Even though it's just a short, it serves as a pilot for a series and I fully intend on making more once I have funding in place. I want to develop it as the first project of its type to be funded by cryptocurrency.
*

Funding this project with cryptocurrency is about proving that it’s more than just a pump-and-dump; it’s not just hype and by demonstrating crypto’s usecase, particularly with regard to digital rights technology, it can be more than just a currency. I really do believe the film industry is where cryptocurrency will truly come in to its own. Traditional funding methods are inefficient and slowed down by bureaucratic middlemen. Cryptocurrency and blockchain technology can change that… and when it does, that’s good news for all of us who are invested in the space. Plus, we get to watch films! Who wouldn't love that?

To those who expressed an interest in donating/ funding, I will be very gratefully accepting contributions from those of you who like what you see and want to see more. I can’t give too much away at this stage, but the next project is a sci-fi time travel film shooting in Los Angeles with an A-list actor attached and an Oscar nominated Director of Photography. It’s bigger in scope and I have a target of $40k for the production. I have listed donation addresses for BTC / ETH / LTC in the video description.

Anyway. Watch. Enjoy... hopefully. And if you do, please make sure to share.

"A question for the skeptics about Bitcoin.  

If the mining reward continues to decrease, which it does, then in order for it to stay profitable, the price of Bitcoin HAS to continue to rise.  What happens if it doesn't.  I understand many people will continue to mine for the sake of the technology, but most won't, I'm guessing.  This would slow down the network, and cause Bitcoin to be less appealing to use, driving down the price, and starting a downward spiral.  

Which do you think is more likely to happen?  Does Bitcoin rise in price to beat this mining issue?  Or will it crash in burn because of this?

In latest Billions episode Boby Axelrode (hedge fund manager) handed over $1mil to a guy in hard wallet (he said: 1 mil in crypto).,1525983506
"Last news was their main banking partner, a small polish bank, got raided after somebody ripped of a Belgian minister. Polish polisch questioned polish bitfinex users and then about a week later they raided the bank. 400 million euro's worth of the polish currency was seized and it looks like the bank was used by a columbian drugs cartel. As to how Bitfinex was affected or how deep their envolvement with that bank was (and/or the drugs cartel) nobody knows. Bitfinex biggest online critic, a person that calls himself bitfinex'd protected all his tweets, then a month later the last thing he tweeted was ""The price of Bitcoin is controlled by 20 people"" and he also deleted his reddit user account called atlasrand1 if I recall correctly.

With Bitfine'ed gone the stream of news and criticisms about Bitfinex/Tether has dried up.

I personally would not be suprised if Bitfinex/Tether is really deep in to a money laundry scheme. I don't think that was the intention behind Tether but I think some criminal organisations must have realized how amazing Bitcoin and Tether is to turn dirty drugs money in to clean money that looks like it was made speculating on crytpo currencies. 

As far as I know, you still can't sell very large volumes of Tether without quickly lowering the price. The last testimony I heard of a big Tether holder was about 4 or 5 month back. This user said that at the best he would get about 1/3 USD per Tether if he tried to sell large quantaties. 

I do not believe for a second that Tether/Bitfinex really have over 2 billion dollars in fiat backing up every Tether. 

This still means that when faith in Tether dissapears it's possible to get an exchange bank run going on and that the market might severly crash. I do believe there are enough trustworthy exchanges around for the market to recover but the big crypto price really was powered by fraud.

This is what I believe. Most people in crypto don't really mind the fact that the rally was started by fraud, because everybody benefited. However if to many people start selling crypto and Tether stops printing money to buy more crypto .... well ... the bubble still has not popped and I believe it will pop. 

It might be an opportunity for Bitcoin Cash to recover better then Bitcoin-BTC and take over the market price leadership position. 

It's also possible that Tether/Bitfinex will be around for many years and that those Bitfinex guys will become the riches people in the world, since they have the power to print as much Tether as they want to and the crypto markets accepts it as fiat. 

Tether does help with liquidity problems on exchanges, since banks and goverment do their best to bully anybody in crypto as much as they can.

But the way Tether operates now is very very dangerous. It might eventually end with disastrous results. But I think it could actually be good for adoption when we get a big crypto purge and all the scam crypto dies and only the real project remains (imho monero, ethereum, btc &amp; bch, and dogecoin)

No matter what the market price says: the real value of any crypto is still the size of the group of people that believe in it and are willing to build an economy around it, seperate from the old system.

That's why I have the biggest faith in Bitcoin Cash. And if BCH does turn in to money, then Ethereum will have an economy it can provide smart contract for that are to complex and dangerous for the BCH network. 

I hope BTC dies, that would be better for the world and that the genuine people still left in BTC join BCH. ",1525983482

Loopring allows users to maintain ownership of their keys, and matches trades across multiple orders/assets rather than just the pair being traded (a big technical advantage IMO).

The ""long term viability"" of Bitcoin is perceived scarcity. It's the primo speculative digital asset. The number one. We could mint a million different types of ""coins"" in our basements but none will ever come close to the original.

I most certainly am not. I'm saying that TA is notoriously unreliable in crypto, and ADA is overpriced. Those two things are not controversial buddy. Tons of people agree with me. WHich is why ADA has fallen again and again since it's ATH.

&gt;Show me your trade history to back up your knowledge if you want to be so smart.

I have positions in BTC (sold near ATH), ETH, XLM,  IOTA, VEN, ARK, and minor positions in some hot shots like REQ and BAT.

What does CZ mean by funds? His old man coins? Binance's funding? His mothers crypto? This is very unspecific language and may very well be used to confuse users into thinking their cryptocurrency is safe to hold on their exchange

&gt;are
Another confusing word. Does this mean that funds haven't been safe before? Why wouldn't CZ add ""are and have always been"". This is clearly a tactic to once again make people think their crypto is secure

&gt;safe
CZ doesn't ever give a definition of safety. MT. Gox claimed to protect their customers crypto, then pulled an exit scam. Safe may very well mean safely being scammed away. Very unclear.

&gt;why would cz scam you?

And this makes his ""network effect"" statement much more logical.  
The nChain idea to use patents in order to create the most feature-full project is wrought with questions, many companies will not enter in such a patent deal. The alternative is to make one coin ""win"" based on network effects. Network effects is where everyone is free to innovate whereever they want, on whatever they want.

So keep on betting that the entire banking industry will collapse. Banks have existed for thousands of years and until Bitcoin offers something better or even the same services as banks, it will never overtake banks. For example, if I want to pay my mortgage in cryptocurrency I need to pay 2-3% more for my payment. If I pay with my bank bill payment service it's completely, 100% free.

"**Fork (software development)**

In software engineering, a project fork happens when developers take a copy of source code from one software package and start independent development on it, creating a distinct and separate piece of software. The term often implies not merely a development branch, but also a split in the developer community, a form of schism.

Free and open-source software is that which, by definition, may be forked from the original development team without prior permission, without violating copyright law. However, licensed forks of proprietary software (e.g.

"&gt; Funny how in one breath you negate the possibility of a magic pixie and then tell a faerie tale.

there are a number of ways you can reconcile your cognitive dissonance. I quoted one above. 

&gt;In 2017 there was a hard fork which, 

here is a good definition of what a fork is. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fork_(software_development)

Bitcoin is not the software that runs the client. Bitcoin is a value exchange network defined by economic incentives, value is subjectively assigned a public-private key pair that cannot be forged in the network. 

how you conceptualize bitcoin determines how you see the network.

Value is not something that can be stored, it's created when you exchange something you value less in a free exchange with someone who values what you have more than their offering. ",1525981925

"\&gt; Unfortunately not. I don't comment a whole lot, but the waters are intentionally murky on both sides of the argument

"There is physical sex and brain gender. While it should be perfectly acceptable for a man to wear dresses and such, it is also scientifically accepted that some people's gender does not match the body they were born into.

As for 'there are no gatekeepers' : Men constantly belittle women and tell them they cannot possibly be interested in these things. Be it gaming ( 'girls don't play games' , despite us being around since the arcade generation), technology and internet ( 'there are no girls online' ) and constant sexist remarks such as 'go back to the kitchen' , 'yes *sweetie* of course you understand', 'you're not a REAL gamer unless you know these five random facts about this game', there is plenty of gatekeeping.

It's the reason there aren't many women in competitive esports : the ones who make a name for themselves get harassed out. The ones interested in technology like bitcoin lay low because if they mention their gender suddenly they're an 'other'. 

I even get it constantly at my job. When I answer the phone people think I'm a receptionist rather than here to answer their questions. They'd rather talk to a man who they perceive to be better with technology than the woman with seniority who is answering the phone.

So yes, there are gatekeepers. Society in general tells us that women shouldn't be expected to be good with technology.

"That's one example.  BTC once had a tipping bot on reddit.  It had to shutdown because no one could afford to tip someone 50 cents while paying a mult-dollar network fee on the BTC block chain.  

BCH avoided the ""fee market"" BTC created by keeping block size below demand.  BCH did this by simply increasing the block size.  More supply to meet growing demand.  

When BCH forked from BTC in August it was too late the prevent the removal of op codes that would allow smart contracts (like Ethereum has) on it.  Next week on May 15th BCH will hard fork to add those back into it.  This will lead to more developers and projects being built on BCH.  

Because of the coming op codes on BCH, more development teams have already started building on the BCH block chain.  Projects like memo.cash and blockpress.com.  These allow uncensored social interactions and more. 

BCH has zero-conf transactions which allows you to make purchases instantly without having to wait for multiple on chain confirmations.  BTC once had this, but broke the security of this feature by adding RBF (Replace By Fee).  Sadly the reason they had to add RBF to BTC was that transactions would get stuck for days or even weeks because the 1 MB blocks were always full so your transaction just never go into a block.  BTC allowed you to use RBF to set a higher fee on your transaction so that miners would be more likely to put your stuck transaction into the next block.  

You can see that the many mistakes BTC has made are not complicated.  You'd think they would have seen the issues they were creating before they happened.  Many people alerted the communities to the issues before they happened but those people were ignored in 2014, 2015, 2016, and then in 2017. 

It was in 2017, when BTC was about to add Segregated Witness, which would fundamentally change the block chain structure that the people who were being ignored took action and decided to fork Bitcoin and create BCH before SegWit.  

Once BCH was created, the road map to fix the things that BTC broke was created and now we will get upgrades to BCH every May and November via Hard Forks.  

Nice and steady innovation coming to BCH.  Just sit back and watch.  May 25th is near!

"&gt;how many variations can you have with them all still properly communicating efficiently

You can have as many ""variations"" in them as you want without a problem as long as they interact with the network in the same way. (That is to say, as long as they follow the same protocol.) So it doesn't matter if the software is written in a totally different language, or if it uses totally different techniques to get to the same result, so long as it does get to the same result.

If there is a single protocol-breaking difference in the code a miner is running, though, that's when you get a chain split, where some implementations accept something as valid that others didn't, and so there are then two states of the network: one according to some implementations, and one according to others. This is unlikely to happen by accident, given the scrutiny with which the developers should be verifying their own code, and given the amount of money that's on the line for the miners that run it. (If a miner accidentally causes a chain split because of an unnoticed protocol difference, but the majority of the hashpower rejects their side of the split, they will have wasted all the electricity they'd used mining on their side of the split before realizing what happened and joining back up with the rest of the network. Miner's margins are, as I understand it, pretty tight.)

Upgrades, like the one happening on the 15th, could technically cause chain splits because the protocol is being changed, and so anyone running the old protocol would reject blocks generated by the newer version of the protocol. That is, again, very unlikely to happen though. All of the major implementations have agreed to upgrade in the same way, and no miners or economically relevant nodes have come out and said ""These upgrades are a bad idea and I'm not going to run the new software!"" (What may happen, though, is that someone purposefully mines on the old ruleset just to make it look like there was contention over the upgrade. That's probably what happened when we hard forked the Difficulty Adjustment Algorithm, and then, when a few blocks were mined using the old DAA, r/Bitcoin cultists shouted ""It's BITCOIN CLASHIC, HAHAHAHA HARD FORKS ARE BAD BECAUSE LOOK, SOMEONE IS WASTING ELECTRICITY MINING ON AN UN-UPGRADED NODE!""... but that didn't last long.)

A miner totally could reject the changes though, if they wanted. Or they could implement even more changes than everyone else, and say that they are upgrading ""even more"". It would be a risk, but one that might pay off if the actual users of the currency agree that their changes make the currency better, and so value their state of the network more than everyone else's state, to the point where users would only bother transacting on their side of the chain split. (Even without replay protection, eventually transactions on one side of the split would become invalid on the other because coins would become tainted by coins mined on one side of the split but not the other.) There is no contention over this upcoming upgrade though, so to mine on the old ruleset would be economic suicide, and no one has considered it worth it to try to implement even more in this upgrade than has been loosely agreed upon already.",1525979907

Your Bitcoin keys existed before 2017. In 2017 there was a hard fork which, for some reason, you are trying to call an upgrade.

There wouldn't have been any credit given. You wouldn't have received any coins on that date because you'd have already had them. I am sure that's perfectly clear to you.

If I'm trying to go out of my way and be overly generous to your claim, then numbers 8, 10, 15, 18, 19, 21, 23, 24, and 27 *might* qualify as ""bcash trolling""; that's 9 out of 32, *if we're trying to be overly generous*. Most of the other submissions don't even come close to doing so. What's more, submissions like number 19 are asking legitimate questions, and getting removed by the moderators rather than answered.

Also, if you're going to try to justify the removals as ""spam because I said so"" then you must also afford /r/Bitcoin the same treatment. The double standard just doesn't work, and it's pretty blatant in this case.

In any case, **even if your lies were true**, the grandparent comment claimed that this subreddit is ""censorship-resistant"" and that content is ""not deleted no matter the topic""... as we can see, this is proven false.

If you want to discuss Bitcoin Gold, Bitcoin 2, Bitcoin Clashic, or Bitcoin Diamond, *the mods here might remove your submission*, which is **the exact opposite** of what was claimed above.

&gt;Plenty of criticisms including yours are allowed, in stark comparison to Bitcoin sub, where even hints of dissidence is a bannable offence.

"&gt;Provide me with some counterexamples. How is it used and for what? 

It's a very fast cryptocurrency with low fees that does everything ripple can do and more. It's targeted at remittance payments, underbanked populations and fintech transactions. Stellar is not flashy. It's not promising all these features that it may or may not deliver on. Stellar works right now. Today. It doesn't need casper, sharding, Thor Hammer, smart economy speculation and promises. You could use stellar today for a variety of things we want to use cryptos for.

&gt;It's hold by the foundation which is reputable until it's not. 

That's your personal call. You could make the same argument that the Ethereum foundation is bogus, or that the Vechain foundation is bogus, or a variety of other ones are bogus. Stellar's foundation can't legally move the coins for any other reasons besides those stated in the mandate. 

&gt;All of the XLM fans are waiting for one product to make their investment worthwhile and that is fairX.

That may be the only one you have heard of, because it's cool, a bit mysterious and applies to Steller's game in the crypto trading world (which everyone is interested in), but Stellar has tons of projects and products that are interesting to me. Notably remittance payments and banking poor AF people. ",1525978272
"&gt; Yeah it comes down to the problem that more money buys more voting power. As far as I'm aware there has not been any solution to this other than the.... ""incentive construct"" (not sure what to call it).. we see in bitcoin where the system was designed in a way where all problems that could arise have been united under the premise that they are not problems as long as the majority of miners stay honest and then everything else was designed around this idea, so everyone is incentivized to not get close to this 50% threshold.

Yeah I think there are certainly some game-theoretic protections with this model but it's probably less than ideal. The more incentives and infrastructure align *against* a centralized model, the better.

&gt;I think that a bidirectional payment channel is awesome. It is very useful for situations where I have to pay the same person multiple times or where there is a back and forth between me and the person I pay. On the other hand, if I only have to make a payment once a normal transaction is the way to go, because with lightning I would have to pay the miners fee twice. Unless I don't close the channel, but that means the person I'm paying can't use those bitcoins outside of the LN.



I think the idea is that LN becomes its own self-contained network, in which participants are incentivized to leave channels open for future transactions. 
Also, either party can close a channel. But again, the idea is not to connect with a certain party to make a payment to then. Rather it's to have a set of channels open already and use the network to route a transaction to them without opening up a direct channel.

&gt;Keeping this in mind, wouldn't I be incetivized to make connections to big hubs rather than individual people?

No, because again, the idea is to keep a handful of channels open (really to whomever -- this aspect can be done automatically by the client). The channels route the transaction automatically, so it doesn't matter if you're going through a hub or a small node.


&gt;This way I don't have to open multiple channels and I can also use LN for one time payments as long as the other person is also connected to me in some way. Which is more likely if everyone connects to big hubs and the big hubs connect each other. 

No, this is just not how it works. You can have a number of channels open with other non-hub nodes and the transaction will find its way to the recipient, so long as there is a route available. Technologies like AMP will rebalance channels or use multiple channels to complete the transaction if needed.

&gt;Opening channels costs money, so I would try to avoid it as a user.

I think more-so you would avoid closing the channels, which is a good thing. Yes, opening channels cost money but if you use LN to making N+1 more transactions than you would otherwise do on-chain, then you're going to be paying less fees overall. This is why once you're up and running on LN, things transacting is basically free until you need to close a channel. The client will simply use AMP and channel re-balancing to ensure that you're able to transact with other nodes on the network whenever you like. All of this would be done automatically by the client so the end user doesn't have to know any of the details. 

&gt;That's what makes it different to normal mesh networks, where extra connections don't really cost anything.

Well obviously on-chain transactions are a fee market. Not sure how else to imagine this given that block space is a finite resource (even with massive blocks).



Being connected to multiple people also doesn't mean I'm a hub, because I might not have the money in my channels to make the transaction. So just being connected to people like in a mesh network doesn't necessarily help.

It does because of technologies like [AMP](https://www.coinspeaker.com/2018/02/07/bitcoin-researchers-launching-atomic-multi-path-payments-amp-via-lightning-network/.)

&gt;That's why I think the more centralized the LN is, the better the usability, but the more risk of a government shutting down hubs etc.

Again, I really think your conception is pretty wrong here. Hub and spoke vs. mesh really doesn't change the viability of the project. So long as a route is available, the transaction will execute. If gov'ts shut down major nodes then participants will just route through other nodes. You can't shut down the entire network and you can't stop nodes from opening up channels with each other. I'm really not seeing the issue with either the hub and spoke OR the mesh conception of the network. As I said, it'll likely be a mixture of both, which again is good. So long as a path exists, any path, the system works perfectly. 

&gt;If we treat LN as only an optional second layer, we would have to make sure the blocks are not close to full too, because if it's only ""use the normal blockchain which is expensive, slow and unreliable"" or ""use the lightning network which is fast and cheap"" then we create an incentive for people to only use the LN, which then puts an increased amount of focus on the LN and its centralization because it becomes the de facto standard way of using bitcoin and more people using LN opening channels puts even more transactions into the blocks.

I'm not sure I'm following. Yes, the chain needs to be able to support opening and closing channels to whatever degree is necessary. But it's *good* to drive transactions of a certain value or less to LN because it's **much** more efficient and doesn't consume additional chain/network resources. 

I think most estimates put block size between 100 Mb and 500 Mb (let's just say 1 Gb to be conservative) to support 8 billion people using LN as intended.


&gt;But the value comes also from people using it. A fully decentralized system only one person in the world uses is worthless. Decentralization is just a means to make sure the system is resistant to manipulations, regulations, censorship etc. There needs to be a balance.

Yes, money is a network good. Networks are strengthened by the number of nodes (i.e. people) that are participants. This is explained by Metcalfe's law. LN provides *much* lower friction transactions, which increases participants and liquidity in terms of BTC. It's also fully trustless and backed by on-chain PoW, so you're not losing any of the benefits of blockchain.

Hopefully that answers some of your concerns, which I think are largely unfounded. LN is a beast and brings truly 'instant' payments (all the way down to micro-micro payments) to full scale (8 billion people). This is orders of magnitude better than on-chain scaling, though some level of on-chain scaling is necessary to facilitate the channels. I think if you looked into it some more, you'd see that concerns over centralization and decentralization are not really applicable to its viability and that the real concern is, as always, making sure the Bitcoin itself remain immutable, decentralized and censorship resistant, which imo largely comes down to preventing big blocks and mining centralization.

2) Because many of the LN solutions are dependent upon aspects like segwit , RBF and the codebase keeps diverging between BTC and BCC it will become increasingly more difficult to copy the work from LN implementations without creating bugs

Sometimes BTC's fees dip below that other currency's fees because the mempool has been nearly empty since January. It's no slower at all despite having multiple hundreds of times the traffic.

&gt; That's why a lot of bitcoin apologists have started describing the currency as a ""store of value""
*Not at all.* Store of value was an explicit part of the economic origin of bitcoin. Roger always misrepresents the Austrian theory of where money comes from to say that it's really important for money to be a transactional currency first and foremost, but the very Austrian economists he quotes did not agree with him on this point. You can read it for yourself here: https://mises.org/library/origin-money-and-its-value (Next to last paragraph, it's clear that money has to be a store of value first and foremost.)

Satoshi and many in bitcoin longer than Roger knew this all along and thankfully the devs realized that bitcoin being a store of value is all-important for its success. Just think about it though; if bitcoin goes to $0, another coin could easily overtake it, or faith in cryptocurrencies as a whole could be lost for decades... But if we just lose the payment rails? That's like switching paypal for amex or something... Very minor in comparison. Consumers won't care if bitcoin gets new payment rails... As long as their value stored in the system is safe. 

&gt; [LN] comes with slight centralisation, something that breaks the original ""Bitcoin promise""
Ah yes, the old centralized LN myth. Did it ever occur to you that the existing wallets aren't likely to evaporate the day LN goes into full use? Regardless, the LN on mainnet has already proven extremely decentralized and it's already becoming standard for LN wallets to automatically balance channels with lesser-connected nodes to ensure it stays widely connected.

&gt; it will not be preferred by retailers since they will always have to convert it back to ""real currency"".
Bitcoin was already a trade-off for them, adding LN to that doesn't create any new tollbooths. (It does give them more fraud protection and instant txs though!)

&gt; An average person is more concerned with credit card fraud than with their transactions being ""censored""
1. Bitcoin will show them what real fraud protection looks like... It'll necessarily have to grow a bit first before that's apparent.
2. Make up your mind. First you say merchants won't like it, but then you say it gives merchants the upper hand over customers. Sheesh. Again, this is nothing new to bitcoin.

Standard, low\-risk merchant? Sure, some card acquirers would give that to you at like $100K a month or less. High\-risk merchant? \(As crypto exchanges are\) Not a chance. Starting fees for high\-risk merchants are 5\-8&amp;#37; \+ 30\-40c compared to 1.5\-2.5&amp;#37; \+10\-20c for a low\-risk merchant and in the majority of cases they'd also want a rolling reserve of 3\-5&amp;#37; a month.

Also costs at 0.5&amp;#37; just isn't realistic, if you say a machine costs $12,000 and is built to last 5 years, then each machine would need to handle $1,200 of volume per day to meet costs whereas these machines are actually doing well to do 1\-2 transactions per day currently.

Factor into that also the cost of doing KYC, since unlike a typical ATM the KYC isn't done by the card issuer, it needs to be done per transaction / unique user, the costs for this range from $3\-15 per verification for the widely used KYC providers.

Your time would probably be better spent trying to understand the tech you're investing in so that you can make better choices but if you'd rather just jump on the witch-hunt bandwagon, that's your prerogative. 

Btw, I didn't read your story. I'm not sure what makes you think that's worth reading but I see no reason to waste my time and, again, what does that have to do with the fact that you're writing bullshit claims about me and turning everything personal? That speaks to *your* character, not mine. Anyhow I did scan the article -- something something about your parents dying and wanting them to love you or something -- that's pretty sad.

"&gt; Everybody knows you don’t get to officially call a fork bitcoin until it meets certain criteria. But it’s perfectly rational for the movement promoting it to say “this is what bitcoin is supposed to be”. Or “this is bitcoin”.

Those are two very different statements. “this is what bitcoin is supposed to be” is not a problem. That's an opinion. Everyone is entitled to their opinion. Believe what you want, and feel free to try and convince others why they should agree with you. It's the internet, right? Let the opinions flow.

""BCH is Bitcoin"" is the problem. It's intentionally misleading. Bitcoin is not a concept, it's a specific blockchain. BCH is an incompatible fork of that blockchain. You think BCH is better, more scalable, more true to the original vision of Satoshi... fine. Let's debate it. But claiming ""BCH is Bitcoin"" is fraud. Plain and simple. BTC is Bitcoin.

&gt; You guys also claim it will never be able to take the name. That is factually false. The tweet I quoted confirms that.

I don't know the future. Neither does Vitalik. But we both agree that right now, trying to claim ""BCH = bitcoin"" is a bad idea.

&gt; I’m not appealing to authority. I’m appealing to his knowledge. He knows how block chain systems work. You guys don’t. Or, you allow your bias to contradict what you know, because you don’t like what may happen.

Jihan Wu also has plenty of knowledge about blockchain tech. Both he and Vitalik are opposed to claiming ""BCH is Bitcoin"".

Do you think Roger Ver has a deeper technical understanding of blockchain than both Vitalik and Jihan? I sure don't.

Both are solid projects, but to think OT will grow to nearly $1bil before Vechain hits $35bil is far fetched, in my opinion.

"&gt;I'm begging anyone to explain why blockchain will be used on things outside of currency. 

Because the processes of verification and validation cost way more money and time than you could possibly imagine. 

&gt;Why would anyone pay so much money for validated data?

Because data that isn't validated is worthless. 

&gt;I have never had this issue in my life outside of currency and voting

I suggest learning about logistics, complex financial transactions and auditing.

&gt;Why I only trust BTC

Not a very smart move, being that BTC's dominance has been dying for almost a year straight

&gt;Reddit and twitter shilled hard by alt coin marketing teams

Bitcoin's followers have an almost religious devotion to the coin. BTC is shilled harder than them all. For increasingly precarious reasons. 

&gt;Lots of promises without adoption

Ethereum, Ripple and dozens of other coins have massive adoption already. Bitcoin's adoption has been quite muted, due to its limitations. It simply isn't functioning as a currency at all. Even the whales are touting it's ""store of value"" now. It's ability to used as entry into the altcoin market is fading, as USD and EUR etc pairings increase.

&gt;ETH is good, but it hasnt gone through POS hard fork yet, it hasnt capped its supply yet, and it failed to scale like BTC.

Both POS and scaling have been validated for ETH. Being careful about those changes does not mean they are not going to happen. 

&gt;XRP has 80% controlled by ripple labs and the founders

XRP is controversial on this sub. But it has a singular purpose that works. It's considered overvalued by most. Which is why it's suffered serious losses from it's ATH. 

&gt;Everything else beyond BTC is really small and hard to care about. 

There are very exciting coins in platforms, privacy, DAGs, targeted market, specialty and data storage. There are also tons of coins/tokens and what not that have yet to be released or invented. Even a tiny percentage of them finding success could create a very stable market for altcoins. Crypto could even possibly replace stocks, IPOs, traditional debt (bonds) and a variety of other financial instruments due to their trustless nature.

&gt;here are top 10 coins without a mainnet release wtf whyyyyyyy?

Because hype. The market is dark and full of terrors. Not everyone is smart money. People are not sure if marketing or technicals will win. There are arguments for both honestly.

&gt;Despite youtube videos and hype, I dont think blockchain is useful for applications

Countless people disagree with you. People at the tippity toppity of their industries. Developers, bankers, investors. It's starting to look like a real market. It's not a gimmick.

&gt;I only think currencies and voting will pay for blockchain validation, centralized servers work better(cheaper/faster) for logistics and media.

We simply do not know that yet.

&gt;Disclaimer, I own 50,000 USD between ETH, XRP, and various top 20 alt coins. I own similar amount in BTC.

You should exit this market immediately if you feel this way.

"&gt; Sure, that's probably the case. I wouldn't be surprised if adoption would be much faster in the hypothetical world where there were more of such issues.

I'm sure that's the case and I think we already to see examples of this in less financially secure countries. There is still the technical barrier though that I think is a significant deterrent.

&gt; Bitcoin isn't designed to compete with these on their playing field.

I mildly agree with this point. Yes, companies put millions into user experience, and Bitcoin can't compete with cute gimmicks and marketing campaigns. I think ""with great user experience"" is the key though. And there will come a time when ""average and acceptable user experience"" will be good enough that the cost savings makes ""great user experience"" in this field obsolete.

I actually think we'll get the best of both worlds. Eventually, market forces and competition will push crypto into these centralized systems. Right now, Chase Pay only lets a user pay with a Chase credit card. My prediction Chase Pay (and or competing providers) *will* create the ""great user experience"" and let you use Bitcoin with it.

Credit cards aren't going away anytime soon. They meet a need for a lot of people and there are valid uses for a credit card. However, for people who don't need what the credit card is offering crypto is going to be easy for Chase and other banks and providers to integrate and support, and that'll be a good thing.

I can already hear some people crying, and yes, I agree that letting a bank be custodian of your crypto largely defeats the greatest benefit. BUT I'm not suggesting anyone should or will give all their crypto to their bank to be custodian of. I'm suggesting that **IF** you want a ""great user experience"" along with your use of crypto, there is a market for it, and banks likely will supply for that demand.",1525969825

**I'd like to make an appeal to those of you reading my comment:**

I have made a promise to myself to contribute and donate to charity if certain targets of mine become a reality. I urge you, dear reader, to do the same. Set targets for yourselves and commit to them. Even if they sound too ambitious because of the little investments you're making into Crypto - you can always say ""I'll contribute X% if my investment goes up by Y%"". It's up to you to put values behind X and Y.

If you do this, you can't lose: your investment has gone up by Y%, so you've reached your desired target. You can't put a price on the satisfaction you get by helping out and making a positive difference in the lives of those people who need and deserve it the most. It's a double win.

I truly believe that blockchain technology is going to revolutionize the world and bring massive transfer / distribution of wealth (it already has). Bitcoin is borderless and is a currency for the world, with the potential to solve some of the world's largest problems. If we're lucky enough to make a fortune by grabbing Bitcoin before the masses do, please take a moment to think about and help those who are far less lucky than we are.",1525968964

"**Financial crisis of 2007–2008**

The financial crisis of 2007–2008, also known as the global financial crisis and the 2008 financial crisis, is considered by many economists to have been the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression of the 1930s.

It began in 2007 with a crisis in the subprime mortgage market in the United States, and developed into a full-blown international banking crisis with the collapse of the investment bank Lehman Brothers on September 15, 2008. Excessive risk-taking by banks such as Lehman Brothers helped to magnify the financial impact globally. Massive bail-outs of financial institutions and other palliative monetary and fiscal policies were employed to prevent a possible collapse of the world financial system.

"You are a not the OP lol,  you've made a bunch of assumptions and you've flipped the narrative way over to  the Bitcoin direction which was not even mentioned but anyway. One assumption you've made is that they have only researched first generation coins as you call them. They did perform a year of research and they are a multi billion dollar company so I don't think this is fair but I will give give you the benefit of the doubt.

\&gt; key concern about the inevitable centralisation of **mining** for this first\- generation coin. 

Blockchain is not defined in generations, it's just another buzz word that gets thrown around by people who have speculated that they may have financial gain from failing competition. There is no such standard. The Ethernet protocol that was created in 1980 is the exact same protocol I am using right now. It has evolved just as the Bitcoin protocol has been [evolving](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IORrMMt3IQg). 

Proof of stake and most, if not all of its implementations have been proposed and researched years and years before this entire alt coin sea and their proponents emerged, all the records are there on bitcointalk and the repository. It was identified as inherently [centralized](https://raiblocks.net/page/representatives). A lot of research has also been done by private companies like blockstream. It is not a generation thing, it is a delicate balance of design trade offs. The Nano devs did not create it it was first used by none only that the man of honorable status, Daniel Larimer.

Bitcoin was not forced towards lightning. Sure the spam attacks gave us a push in that direction which is great but the [concept](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2013-April/002417.html) of lightning network was described by Satoshi himself and development started long before any type of scaling debates or spam attacks. 

It's so much easier to manipulate voting dynamics than it is to gather up majority hash rate. Hash power requires a real world scarce resource and even if you do manage to gather it up your not incentivised to be a bad actor with that hashing capability. DPOS votes don't really cost much, especially if the speculative token was to crash in value. There is no incentive for voting nodes to agree with the correct fork and for minority nodes to agree with the majority fork. Lets also not forget that Bitgrail was hacked and a large portion of the Nano supply is in the hands of bad actors.

Nanos implementation lacks byzantine fault tolerance. Satoshi created proof of work to solve the byzantine generals problem. You can't just throw it out and then say ""these entities are now going to decide what the correct fork is"" because the speed at which information travels is not instantaneous. If and when there is  a cascade of inter\-chained reorgs when more than one double spends are reverted by a fork, the correct network state will be uncertain and the worse part is no one will know about it.

Complex game theory can start arising too, opposed to a POW where it's naturally self correcting and going against the majority, even if its just for idealistic reasons will cost you dearly.

POS can only go two directions. One direction is centralization which is the route Nno has chosen. The other is performing the same if not more work  ",1525968066

There are good-size airdrops just for signing up and joining the Telegram groups of partners (so far, they've been in the $30-55 range), and huge rewards for super-troopers who contribute to the community. Also, no one is required (or even asked) to go shill on social media.

To me, the fact that they're not trying to get everyone off the street to buy into an ICO gives them a ton of credibility. In the last day, the 2Gether Telegram community has almost doubled in size, and we're looking at hitting 1,000 participants very soon--that's the next [Parachute](https://www.parachutetoken.com/tokens) airdrop milestone.

"**Poe's law**

Poe's law is an adage of Internet culture stating that, without a clear indicator of the author's intent, it is impossible to create a parody of extreme views so obviously exaggerated that it cannot be mistaken by some readers or viewers for a sincere expression of the parodied views.

The original statement of the adage, by Nathan Poe, was:



Without a winking smiley or other blatant display of humor, it is utterly impossible to parody a Creationist in such a way that someone won't mistake for the genuine article.

"Yah.  Like so many other herd animals, humans instinctively submit, are trained from birth to figure out who commands, and submit without hesitation.  We compete with each other to submit to an authority we cannot even identify sometimes, or for which there is only a symbol.  From the start, cryptocurrency has been under severe state suppression, yet now they embrace it increasingly, because they cannot kill it.

State response to innovation:
1)  Kill it.
2)  If 1 fails, then suppress it, while studying uses of it for more effective herd control.
3)  If suppression fails, and widespread use appears likely, then subvert the human organization that is responsible for it.  This explains what happens to Bitcoin.
4)  If subversion is bypassed (Bitcoin Cash), embrace it, and claim it as more evidence of the benevolence and genius of the almighty state.",1525967494

Ethereum also or BTC only ? ,1525967021
"Feb 28, 2018

&gt; In an annual report released yesterday, JP Morgan Chase states that the Bitcoin and Ethereum (and the cryptocurrency market in general) pose a great risk for its operation and business model.

&gt; The affirmation was made in the sense that cryptocurrencies have put a lot of pressure on the bank’s financial instruments and made them innovate to maintain old customers and keep new clients coming. The report declares that: “Both financial institutions and their non-banking competitors face the risk that payment processing and other services could be disrupted by technologies, such as cryptocurrencies, that require no intermediation,”, also stating the fact that investing in crypto would cut (or ax) the middleman. This would effectively bring extinction to the bank’s intermediation business model as we know it today.

It means making smarter decisions when I move to cold wallets, but thats about it. For paying people coinbase met all needs except paying my mortgage.",1525966937
"Username burns are the last refuge of the dumb fuck who knows nothing about BTC or BCH. I exchange mine for nothing, instantly. Not that I'm doing much but HODLing right now.

What are you so afraid of?",1525966864
"In the sense of that option being open for a very limited amount of time and only people aware and involved in crypto back then we’re able to partake, yes a bit unfair.

Also, if the devs were able to give out the nano for free like that, you can bet your bottom dollar they gave to their friends, family and themselves too. In fact, when the faucet ran into issues, they turned it off early after only around half distribution or so. 

Nano may have its place, but would it ever be “THE” global currency...nah, it couldn’t.

Still doesn’t mean you won’t make good money from hodling and I would encourage you to do so. ",1525966807
"Granted, but that in itself doesn't influence the price at all. The price is what influences the difficulty as a higher price justifies more mining  power which results in a higher difficulty.  
This is a one-way street however. A higher difficulty doesn't make Bitcoin more valuable (once the diminishing returns on the value of security are exhausted) and it certainly doesn't raise the price floor. ",1525966787

"Need to get this off my chest for my own sanity.

Had a huge (and I mean huge) stack of TRAC that I’ve been accumulating for months and always planned to just hold it and stake and everything, was super involved in telegram, researched a ton, talked it up, etc. Then I arbitraged a couple thousand extra TRAC. So I was feeling pretty cocky. So I joined the BCN party and nearly doubled my whole stack. So I was even more cocky, so I tried swing trading some more stuff and keep the ride going.

You probably know how this story ends.

Now I’m down 65% total on a huge investment. If I had not done a thing the last two days I would be up 150%, enough for the engagement ring I need to buy, pay off my student loans, repair my car, and make up for a few other bad decisions.

Don’t be me. I felt like a crazy gambler on my way down and now I wonder if I’ve always been using crypto as an addiction to substitute for my being sober from drugs and alcohol for 3 years. 

Cashing out now, taking the loss. My hands are too weak for this space and I don’t trust myself to be responsible any more. I’ve been losing sleep and productivity at work over this, which really is pitiful. I need to step back and reflect on the risks I can and cannot take, and I absolutely cannot resort to behaviors that give me the same high as alcohol did.

Good luck to all!!!",1525966645

"The problem as I see with this theory is that much of the miner's retained earnings are likely in BTC,  and if the chain goes dead, they are all broke.  If they preemptively try to sell, the value of BTC goes down significantly and they are also all broke.

"&gt; heir low 4% fees for cards is based on huge volume and years of data on their fraud rates 

Neither of which apply to ATMs. Cash in, crypto out. You're not looking at charge backs, you're looking at ATM theft... which is pretty uncommon and very cheap to insure.

4% by Coinbase (and frankly anything over 2%) is **ridiculous**. You can get 1.25% from a decent merchant for Visa/MC with six figures of daily volume. That's peanuts at scale. For a business that doesn't have to deal with charge backs (like these ATMs) it's ridiculous. Fees should be 2% to process and a 1% slippage insurance from the market buy. Costs on both will a half percent less each. Anything else is extortion.",1525966517

"Fair enough. However only having BTC pairings isn't ideal either. When BTC goes up quickly, people dump their alts causing the alts' satoshi value to drop hard. And when BTC goes down again the already lower satoshi value of alts drops in USD value as well. You're dealing with 2 volatile assets then. Having a USDT pairing at least eliminates the volatility of BTC.",1525966382

* You can **send and receive** testnet Bitcoins on blockchain and lightning network.
* Support **multiple wallets**.

* Show **outgoing and incomings payments** on the lightning network.
* Transfer money from *checking account*-&gt;*savings account* by **closing channels**.
* Transfer money from *savings account*-&gt;*checking account* by **creating channels to an existing peer or by QR code**.
* Displays lightning network information (**number of nodes, edges, etc.**).
* Show a **list of nodes** and filter nodes by pubkey or alias.
* **lnd-as-a-service**: runs [lnd](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd) in the background (can run 24/7 if the wallet is open) and you can
access the instance even outside the app by using the https certs and macaroons which are displayed in **About** screen.

"There's likely no generosity here. All of the donations were likely related to countering capital gains taxes. Depending on where this person lives, let's say their capital gains taxes are 40%: for them to owe $55,000,000 they would have sold and removed roughly $140,000,000 from the ecosystem;  How a qualified appraiser reasonably determines ""fair market value"" in something as volatile at incentivized crypto-assets - I don't know - it's probably going to end up gouging society via taxes as well.

Likewise, they potentially did absolutely nothing except do mining early on (or make a good bet) and promote Bitcoin et al, getting more people to adopt/buy them - allowing them to then sell with where we're at in the scheme.

These incentivized crypto-assets are also a Ponzi-Pyramid structure, where like in a traditional Ponzi scheme it's usually the early adopters who gain more and the later adopters who lose more; technically with a single stock broker making the decisions, they would get to decide exactly who profits from the investment, and who's money they run or exit with.

It is possible they donated more than they required to counter taxes, however I doubt they'd verify that with independently selected third-parties - and it'd be naive to merely take their word for it.

It's also other people's future money being donated - and those people are now bearing the unrealized cost, until they sell at least; not such a big deal for the receiving party of a donation, however it's a problem if they were actually purchased.

And now unfortunately these charities have become aligned and vested in these crypto-asset donations maintaining their current value, or promoting them so they go up even for (for no actual work being done) - trying to get later adopters to buy in a higher perceived value; if actual work was being done that was worthwhile to pa for, people could pay in a non-incentivized crypto-asset, if the immutable blockchain ledger is a primary value.

It's only reached such proportions because in part because of its global nature, and because there isn't a single stock broker - it's an situation that's been forced on regulators around the world, and who are being influenced by lobbyists to attempt to indoctrinate regulators based on their biased understanding. It's a global pyramid of cards stacked waiting to tumble, the people making the money are the earlier adopters, and those [platforms] selling the shovels/services for this new ""gold"" rush.

Those who think society is oblivious to the Ponzi-Pyramid structures are going to find disappointment. The positive rallying for Bitcoin et al is because you're all aligned, incentivized to want them to work out - and that sentiment isn't equally countered solely because people keeping the system in check aren't at minimum disproportionately incentivized (e.g. they may have a government job with a salary that pays fiat currency as their incentive to do the work), nor are there the masses -  the ""HODL"" rallying of both when a crypto-asset value is at a high and a low is interesting, to say the least: https://hackernoon.com/analyzing-every-reddit-comment-mentioning-hodl-since-2017-part-one-d536eb8364ad

It is great - yes - that there is at least one person who perhaps did indeed invest the majority (50%+1?; if they're telling the truth) of their crypto-assets to charities who could realize the value now (and I like a lot of those charities), or the charities may hold onto them until they crash in value. Or they will slowly sell them off as a trickle to not upset the ecosystem [as the ecosystem has seemed to have learned to manage for now] - meanwhile the remainder of the community, likely individuals with the smaller amounts invested, are doing the HODL rallying game keeping the perceived value artificially higher - meanwhile earlier adopters are extracting money at a rate that new money is coming into the system (based on the confidence the stabilized price - maintained by the HODLing - allows for).

Now what about the unknown list of bad actors who have already entered the system, who are perhaps planning to put more money into it to keep it perpetuated, and will attempt at any means to cause more-to-all of society to adopt it so the artificially perceived value - and wealth/buying power - is unreasonably and unnecessarily reallocated weighted towards them, the earlier adopters?

I would recommend everyone think through the long-term negative consequences, they aren't outweighed by the potential positives - and those positives are all achievable by non-Ponzi-Pyramid scheme incentivized means. The long-term in discussions, particularly the negatives, is rarely brought up - I imagine heavily to avoid flame wars, or you simply get ""downvoted to hell"" by those, as I mentioned above, incentivized to rally for their gains.

It's interesting too that they didn't liquidate the $55MM (or their full amount into fiat currency), and then donate that to charities. Aside from the negative impact dumping that quickly could have on its perceived value - like we've seen before, it's apparently better for tax reasons too to donate a crypto-asset; I imagine now that larger financial institutions are involved and other well-organized organizations have created a legitimate market structure, perhaps like Coinbase, are keeping large sums of capital at bay from investors wanting to buy a lot -- so they can buy up large quantities when necessary to avoid exposing volatility.

If you think the layman person investing say as little as $100 (that little or less for them to be aligned with the masses of the ecosystem, to be part of the mob) is educated enough to make a sound investment decision, to understand this complex holistic ecosystem, well you're wrong and if you profit off of selling your incentivized crypto-asset you're taking advantage of people. This is why stock markets were formed with regulations and oversights and due diligence for individual companies, etc. Perhaps you reading this don't fully understand it either, or didn't, and it's long-term implications. So are you going to pretend it's not a Ponzi-Pyramid scheme and hope it works out, and that society isn't actually being taken advantage of? I hope more of you sooner than later realize this. Some people do know this is the game they're playing, and they're happy to take advantage of others - however it's immoral to do if they don't know they're playing that game.

The simple truth is the proposed benefits of the structures allowed with incentivized crypto-assets don't work out long-term if you can't separate the two systems. If the system inherently has a Ponzi-Pyramid structure - you can't simply dismiss that, and you can't - as a society - allow it; the two systems being a model that leads to ""incentivized collaboration"" leading to independently owned services tied together through a transaction layer (that logically doesn't make sense to have an incentivized structure), and that of Ponzi-Pyramid schemes.",1525965122

"1. Yes your source is correct. 1000 transactions per minute is 1,667 transactions per second which is what i stated. Nano handles 7k+ per second. 

2. Fair enough. Very reasonable 

3. That’s not true at all and not how mining works. Bitcoin can only allow 4,200 transactions every 10 minutes. Maximum. Period. End of story. This will never change without a hard fork with BTC.

A few days after I sold BCH suddenly surged. 

I'm not bitter, but the lesson I learned wasn't that I should have held on with patience, the real takeaway was; don't buy coins that you don't *really* see a future in.

Aside from all that, even if I had held onto BCH, I would still have been down in BTC since it hasn't managed to crack 0.18 yet.

I was holding a variety of other coins that all dipped, some even deeper than BCH. But I never once doubted they would recover and never felt like a bag holder. (I know I could have increased my stack by selling and rebuying, but I didn't have the confidence that I would get the timing right.)

It will *always* be cheaper, faster, and easier to manage huge numbers of transactions with great user experience in a centralised system than a decentralised one.

That doesn't mean we shouldn't try to make bitcoin as cheap, fast, and easy as possible; because I think we *can* make it really good on all of these fronts.  But it's going to be a lot more work than it would have been for Chase to create Chase Pay.  It'll also be worth it.",1525964597

"Regarding ASICs and voting power:

Yeah it comes down to the problem that more money buys more voting power. As far as I'm aware there has not been any solution to this other than the.... ""incentive construct"" (not sure what to call it).. we see in bitcoin where the system was designed in a way where all problems that could arise have been united under the premise that they are not problems as long as the majority of miners stay honest and then everything else was designed around this idea, so everyone is incentivized to not get close to this 50% threshold.

I have spend some time thinking about how this could be improved, to have a fairer system where everyones vote counts, but unsurprisingly I haven't come up with anything.

---

Regarding the lightning network:

I think we disagree on the interconnection between LN and the blockchain base layer.

So maybe lets start with the basics.  
I think that a bidirectional payment channel is awesome. It is very useful for situations where I have to pay the same person multiple times or where there is a back and forth between me and the person I pay. On the other hand, if I only have to make a payment once a normal transaction is the way to go, because with lightning I would have to pay the miners fee twice. Unless I don't close the channel, but that means the person I'm paying can't use those bitcoins outside of the LN.

Keeping this in mind, wouldn't I be incetivized to make connections to big hubs rather than individual people? This way I don't have to open multiple channels and I can also use LN for one time payments as long as the other person is also connected to me in some way. Which is more likely if everyone connects to big hubs and the big hubs connect each other. Opening channels costs money, so I would try to avoid it as a user. That's what makes it different to normal mesh networks, where extra connections don't really cost anything.  
Being connected to multiple people also doesn't mean I'm a hub, because I might not have the money in my channels to make the transaction. So just being connected to people like in a mesh network doesn't necessarily help.

That's why I think the more centralized the LN is, the better the usability, but the more risk of a government shutting down hubs etc.

&gt;  it's not like LN centralization hampers Bitcoin decentralization or effects its security. It's simply a layer that runs on top. 

If we treat LN as only an optional second layer, we would have to make sure the blocks are not close to full too, because if it's only ""use the normal blockchain which is expensive, slow and unreliable"" or ""use the lightning network which is fast and cheap"" then we create an incentive for people to only use the LN, which then puts an increased amount of focus on the LN and its centralization because it becomes the de facto standard way of using bitcoin and more people using LN opening channels puts even more transactions into the blocks.

&gt; The blockchain has to be decentralized, otherwise is can't retain store of value properties. The LN topology can take many forms and still work.

But the value comes also from people using it. A fully decentralized system only one person in the world uses is worthless. Decentralization is just a means to make sure the system is resistant to manipulations, regulations, censorship etc. There needs to be a balance.",1525964267

Obviously someone who isn't into crypto but this type of sentiment is rampant still. People DO NOT understand why decentralization or real ownership is important. Most people are more-or-less happy with their custodians because for most, the custodian actually seems pretty good.

I think it's mostly the rich in the West who see the value in actually owning your assets. When a poor person goes to the bank and withdraws $200 it's a breeze, but when a rich person wants to withdrawal $20,0000 or $200,000 these are the people who realize they don't really own what the custodian is holding.",1525964218
"No thanks, I’ve alrea effectively “placed my bets” with regards to the future of BCH vs BTC.

To expand on reasoning here is a post I made a few moths ago:



Miners do indeed chase profit, that’s precisely why I believe a switch to BCH is imminent, they stand to make billions from it.

At some point, some point very soon, the SHA256 miners need to pick a winner between BTC and BCH.

The miners don’t benefit from LN. The miners don’t want LN. The miners want a return to the original design of on chain scaling. BCH is a return to on chain scaling.

The largest miners are the very people who have been supporting Bitcoin Cash.

Look at the largest BCH address here: https://bitinfocharts.com/top-100-richest-bitcoin%20cash-addresses.html

That 440,000+ BCH belongs to a group representing the majority of bitcoin hashrate. They have not been selling, they have specifically been hoarding BCH while waiting for the infrastructure to be put in place to ensure a smooth transition.

That infrastructure is almost complete. Trading pairs on exchanges, BTC to BCH shapeshift built into major wallets, Bitpay adding it as a default option on all invoices.

When the miners finally flip the switch the BTC chain will grind to a halt, as it crashes it will take every paired alt with it leaving only BCH as a green lifeboat in an ocean of red.

Bitcoin is a system of economic incentives.

When the flip happens that BCH will hit $10k easily, making that hoard worth $4.4Billion and growing. Bitcoin will regain its squandered network effect and become unassailable as the future of money.

It’s almost time.",1525964211

"**Buffett 'Disciple' Condemns Investor's Views On Bitcoin**

https://www.coindesk.com/venture-capitalist-disciple-of-buffett-condemns-his-views-on-bitcoin/

Venture capitalist Chamath Palihapitiya has countered billionaire Warren Buffett's recent derogatory statements on bitcoin, stating that the cryptocurrency is ""important.""

His comments come after Buffett, the chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, argued that bitcoin is more of a gamble than an investment at the end of April, and then, last weekend at a shareholders' meeting, he said bitcoin is ""probably rat poison squared.""

While calling himself a Buffett ""disciple,"" Palihapitiya told CNBC that Buffett is wrong about bitcoin.

""Not everybody is right all the time,"" he told the news source, further suggesting that that knowledge about technology is not in Buffett's ""circle of competence.""

Palihapitiya, a former Facebook and AOL executive, went on to push for the cryptocurrency's benefits, saying it is a replacement to gold and:

""Something like bitcoin is really important, because it is not correlated to the rest of the market.""

Speaking about the financial crisis, he said that ""things that we thought were hedges went away"" and ""broke down."" Bitcoin is viewed as providing a hedge to traditional finance by those who have owned the digital currency, he said.",1525963713

Hi guys, thanks for opening this topic. I was trying to solve this mystery for a while. 

I unfortunately sold BTC and other cryptos during the 1st year, which means that I have to pay taxes for that. 

Now, I am not sure what happens after that. Let me explain with an example:

* 1st  June 2017 : I bought BTC with 100 euros
* 15th July 2017 : I bought ETH with some of the previous BTC  \-\-\-\&gt; I should pay capital gain / income tax \(I am not sure about the difference\) \- 1st year rule
* 20th May  2018 : I bought IOTA with some of the previous ETH \-\-\-\&gt; I should pay capital gain / income tax \(I am not sure about the difference\) \- 1st year rule
* 10th June 2018 : I bought ADA with some of the previous BTC, ETH and IOTA \-\-\-\&gt; **I pay no taxes because the 1st year rule does not apply anymore?**
* Any further transactions with the initial 100 euros to BTC are no longer taxable.

If anyone could illuminate with the above example, I would appreciate it!

&gt; The modus operandi strongly resembles Adam Back &amp; co. when they launched the second notorious fork coin (excluding UASF which didn't fork off; you know which fork coin I'm talking about, I don't want to advertise it by mentioning its name, PM me if you're still wondering) and had multiple officially endorsed wallets which were stealing seeds and did steal the bitcoins secured by them, as well as the various fork coins. One of these scam wallets was their official fork of Bitcoin Core. As with this case discussed here, only the Windows binary seemed to be affected (as they themselves claimed) and replaced on their github, and the Linux version was not. Someone could go back and find that binary and investigate it and see if the particulars of sending the seed or private keys via a HTTP POST request also match. They also had some Electrum forks specific to their fork coin which were also malicious, they may also match this.
&gt; 
&gt; Apart from Adam Back who publicly advertised that fork coin practically before anyone else there are also other less known public names who endorsed it and have played some part in those scams. You can find them on their official websites, BTCT announcement thread, twitter, etc. I hope this helps anyone who may want to get to the bottom of this.

"I'm not sure cheating is the correct term to use.  IMHO, cheating is exclusive to institutions that have principled rules built into them to deter someone from breaking them through consequences such as sports or school, and once you're out of said institutions, there is no longer cheating, only lengths you're not willing to go or ideas you didn't think to use.  Guy lied on his resume and got the job over you?  Sorry, he didn't cheat to get the job, he just did something you either didn't think of or weren't willing to do.  The only thing negative that will happen to the guy if he gets caught is he loses the job, hes not gonna lose life points or get some black mark on his life record.  Probably not the best example, but what I'm trying to explain through this is its cheating if the other person is breaking principle rules in place, and in the markets, just like life, these rules don't exist, just individual social contracts we have that we hope others don't break.  If someone breaks the social contract, it's not cheating, it's just something that happens.  Don't go into this thinking there are rules in place and a way to play the game.  There are no rules, especially in the crypto market.  ",1525963554

&gt;In retail, it’s critical to keep things moving at the point of purchase.

VisaNet handles an average of 150 million transactions every day and is capable of handling more than 24,000 transactions per second.

The second point is true, however it's still a downside at the moment, downsides aren't always talking about the future. I don't think the average joe will ever care enough about crypto to get that far down the ranking table. Nano has to prove itself better than other payment solutions and then get big retailers accepting it to actually bridge that gap.

Nano isn't decentralized just like most other currencies aren't yet, 2 nodes hold over 50% of the hashing power: https://arewedecentralizedyet.com/ .
Absolutely they should be responsible for it, the same way other currencies have taken responsibility of managing their communities on reddit.

"It's great marketing but how can this possibly work without liquidity though?

- Financial institutions ""connect to digital asset exchanges in originating and destination corridors.""
- Originating currency is exchanged into XRP which provides the necessary liquidity to power the final payment, and then in seconds that XRP is exchanged into the destination currency in the second digital asset exchange
- Once this transaction takes place, the funds are sent out on the local rails of the destination country for payout.

Mexico's largest exchange does a volume of only $300K in XRP.  That is enough for some pilot programs but it can't really be as the standard method.  And most corridors of the world, there is no XRP exchange so there is zero liquidity.  Even take Zimbabwe for instance, there is one crypto exchange (Golix) and it only trades Bitcoin.  Korea does the most XRP volume but it's still under $100 Million and that is not enough liquidity for remittances and you also need it both at source and destination.  

The only way this would ever work is when crypto has mass adoption and there is massive liquidity.  But then people would be sending crypto to each other across countries instead of paying a bank or remittance service to exchange their money to crypto, send it to another country and exchange to the local currency.  

This is one of the reasons that banks have said they can't use XRP (the other being regulation)

If whales manage to keep BTC relevant after 2020 and into 2025 and beyond there won't be much to mine and dump. Strong hands and new money via easier ways to move retirement funds and that kind of big money into BTC and then BTC = high price. But then BTC will need to be accepted lots of places.

"I’m glad at least one person is discussing the actual survey and its implications on crypto as a whole rather than just seeing “VeChain” and “PwC” in the headline and then commenting about how great it is they’re working together. 


As to the survey, one concerning thing to me is how many companies appear to be doing their own in-house block chain development. Only about a third of companies are cooperating with or investing in external blockchain start-ups. If this trend holds up then it could have big implications on the crypto market. For example, projects which connect different blockchains (those made by numerous companies) may be the best thing to invest in.


On another note, I was a bit surprised to see government use for blockchain as the number 2 use, above even healthcare. I’m not even aware of any crypto projects focusing on this application. As to my point above, governments may be less likely that large companies to develop their own in-house blockchain technology so crypto projects focusing on government use may be valuable in the long run.


Just some off the cuff thoughts on the survey. Would love to hear some more opinions on the survey rather than a bunch of comments about how closely VeChain and PwC are working.",1525961749

The more normal the word Bitcoin begins to sound, the more easy it will be for the currency's usage to spread. Even if businesses initially want to use services like BitPay to reduce their volatility risks, that is only one middleman they need to remove in the future to start taking Bitcoin themselves.

Be proactive and positive. If there are scams out there, call them out by telling people why they are to be avoided. Don't just bash them without any supporting evidence or solutions for those who don't know better. 

Help those in need and Bitcoin will keep being a positive force in the world.",1525961739

"&gt; Hardware won't be enough to bridge the gap.

Can you elaborate on the 'gap'? are you saying there is a gap in the tx/s speed that can be achieved theoretically and what it is capable of now? as the max tx/s speed is unproven, so prove the 'gap'. 

&gt; Vendors is only one side of the story. If nobody is using what the vendors are offering then it's still nobody. 

The same argument of 'if nobody uses it, its valueless' was said about BTC. Now look. The simple matter is people will use it, are using it, and as far as its peers go it does everything better. We know where we are on the adoption curve, its a matter of time before the average Joe becomes a bit more savvy about what the key differences are between coins, at which point NANO will blow up. at which point you can see the tx/s as promised for yourself. 

&gt; Shilling definitely should reflect bad on the core team, it's their community that they're fostering.

Probably the funniest answer. you want a *decentralized* currency to have a team that is responsible for how its users behave? Having your cake and eating it slightly... Do you think Satoshi should of been responsible for BTC maximalists? Vitalik is responsible for everything that occurs on the Ethereum network and its Dapps? And you say behave as if the NANO community are the worst, come and take a look at the nano sub, you will see very little regarding price, and more regarding adoption and in depth discussion of how to grow the coin OURSELVES - remember, as a decentralised cryptocurrency, its up to us as much as the core team to drive adoption. 

The other is a whataboutism you're correct. I didn't think you would require an explanation on why instant fee-less transfer of wealth globally is a big enough user case to not require additional functionality. I think there is room for many types of cryptos and dont subscribe to the tribalism or bashing that others do, but i wanted to understand that because you thought NANO as a payment currency didn't do enough, what your thoughts are on other payment currencies are, given how only being used as a payment method isn't a big enough user case in your eyes.

Over the past 7 days it has been more profitable to mine BCH.  
Over the past 7 days, 86% of hash power has been mining BTC, 13% mining BCH.  
Over the last 3 hours, hashpower suddenly shifted to 94% BTC, 5% BCH.  

In 9 hours the difficulty on BTC will increase by almost 4%.

"But right now bitcoin is pretty useless, it is expensive and slow to use, definitely completely unusable right now for micropayments; it is hardly used anymore by retailers, the number of the top 500 internet retailers accepting Bitcoin had fallen to just three.

That's why a lot of bitcoin apologists have started describing the currency as a ""store of value"" rather than a form of payment, because frankly, there is absolutely no reason to pay with bitcoin unless you're buying something illegal like weed on darkweb. Its only hope is in the lightning network that will make it somewhat usable, but that comes with slight centralisation, something that breaks the original ""Bitcoin promise"", and until bitcoin becomes widely used, which right now looks unlikely, it will not be preferred by retailers since they will always have to convert it back to ""real currency"". 

An average person is more concerned with credit card fraud than with their transactions being ""censored"", and bitcoin offers no protection in that regard because of the irreversible nature of transactions. So bitcoin, in my humble opinion, is not both, it's hardly one, and until the transactions fees are reduced, the speed increased, and some form of consumer protection is guaranteed, there is absolutely no reason for ""regular people"" to start using it on a larger scale.

Disclaimer, I own 50,000 USD between ETH, XRP, and various top 20 alt coins. I own similar amount in BTC.

"I don't understand.  If there's no proof of work it's not a blockchain.

Note that you absolutely can re-do proof of work.  It's just the same as doing it in the first place.  

&gt; the proof of work protocol of Bitcoin for example ensures that it takes 10 minutes for calculation of the proof of work

Not in the way you mean.  The difficulty adjusts every 2000 blocks, or something, to a level that would mean blocks are found every 10 min on average.  But the time it takes you to remake blocks depends on your hashpower.  If you have enough, you can do it quicker than 10 min per block, and overtake the rest of the network.

&gt; And a person cannot alter the data in a old block as the Blockchain data is innumerable So how does this parallel Blockchain arise is it same as a hard fork

There is nothing to stop anyone altering data in an old block.  But nodes will not recognise it as valid.  To make it valid you have to redo the proof of work.  At that point you will have created a parallel blockchain, different to the one the rest of the network is using.  But if you make it long enough, and make it valid by doing all the proof of work, your chain will be adopted.",1525957067

"**Communist society**

In Marxist thought, communist society or the communist system is the type of society and economic system postulated to emerge from technological advances in the productive forces, representing the ultimate goal of the political ideology of Communism. A communist society is characterized by common ownership of the means of production with free access to the articles of consumption and is classless and stateless, implying the end of the exploitation of labour. 

Communism is a specific stage of socioeconomic development predicated upon a superabundance of material wealth, which is postulated to arise from advances in production technology and corresponding changes in the social relations of production. This would allow for distribution based on need and social relations based on freely-associated individuals.

"With the caveat that you've done much more research on this than I and so my opinion is less informed, here it goes for what it is worth:

High fees on BTC seem to be the main reason for the push for second layer on BTC, with quicker transaction speeds an added and useful benefit.

As BCH is dedicated to larger blocks, fees should stay very low unless an insane amount of transaction growth happens faster than big block progress and other porotocol efficiencies. If that were to happen, then second layer would be a good option to have. 

If BCH fees stay low and transaction maleability was removed and second layer was widely supported, I would still prefer to use on chain transactions for the security and simplicity. 

I also support a quicker block times and/or weak/sub blocks to reduce the time for on chain confirmation beyond what 0 conf provides for smaller transactions. 

As long as transaction maleability can be removed safely and without drawbacks, then I think it should be added to open up additional use cases and I don't believe it will reduce on chain demand (as long as the blocks have space to keep fees low)

The child pays for parent malleability workaround seems very limited, such as I don't believe you would be able to open a payment channel that way.

The opt in malleability free transaction seems interesting though I don't understand its drawbacks versus a full fix to all transactions. Such as would it work with P2SH or not.

This is irrelevant to traders. Once a coin gets ""supply capped"" the price doesn't matter so much - precisely the same happened to Smartcash. Due to the exploit, most big exchanges locked the wallets. So people started trading with the limited amount on the exchange - which is why it went from 40c to over 2 dollars (traders making money off each other and poor saps who don't know what's going on getting caught up)

Likewise with BCN. The price started rocketing on Binance with the news of acceptance (naturally) but when deposits of BCN stopped hitting the exchange - the supply limit caused the price to keep rising to **an unnatural level**

It really doesn't matter what coin it is or what the quality is. These things aren't linked to e.g. a company like shares are - so there's no ""tangible"" value that can be determined. You can literally sit down with a calculator (and knowledge) and figure out roughly how much a share is worth - with crypto this can rarely be done. No one knows, so much of the value is market based psychology

That's why the prices can go so mental under such conditions

When people in crypto don't understand something, they often call it a ""scam"". It's very common.

No one probably wants to be around you because you have this false sense of entitlement or superiority complex.

In reality, you're a college dropout who lost all their money trading bitcoin trying to get rich quick and can't keep a job. Probably because you're an insufferable person.

"**Network effect**

A network effect (also called network externality or demand-side economies of scale) is the positive effect described in economics and business that an additional user of a good or service has on the value of that product to others. When a network effect is present, the value of a product or service increases according to the number of others using it.

The classic example is the telephone, where a greater number of users increases the value to each. A positive externality is created when a telephone is purchased without its owner intending to create value for other users, but does so regardless.

In essence your money can be put to work by lending it to others or acquiring stakes in productive ventures.

If you give it to the bank they get to exercise that option and generally do pay you little or interest.

Locking your money in to get zero fees is traded for the value of committing that money to a venture which has a real monetary value.

Further inflation is a very real aspect of the wider global economy; the spending power of your idle money decreases everyday and noticeably every year. Your money is actually shrinking in the bank while you marvel at your zero fees.

Bitcoin via cash fork  or lightening network offers near zero fees for transactions and a store of value that is far milder in inflation and in fact presently hyper deflationary year on year.

Good enough answer?",1525951584

What does failing mean? Because the success of a project *does not* necessarily translate to price appreciation. When will ppl get this. These aren’t stocks or bonds ur not buying equity of company or their debt that’s owed. Ur speculating that the price of a coin/token will increase as a project progress but these tokens and coins have no intrinsic value like stocks. We’ve yet to see a token that’s absolutely necessary for a project to function but rather tokens created as a proprietary use case that could just as easily be substituted for an already existing one. Tokens and coins are vehicles of equity for the *companies* not the users. But that doesn’t mean they don’t have value. The market defines the value which is just as important as fundamentals when talking about the crypto space. ,1525951402

"&gt;People generally don't lose or give away their bank account and routing numbers.

You freely give those numbers away to anyone who accepts a check from you. They are literally printed along the bottom. Possessing those numbers does not give anyone access to your money. The signature line is what does that. Your bank has a strong, enforceable legal obligation to confirm that all withdrawals are actually authorized by the account's rightful owner. The fact that you apparently don't understand any of that is a perfect illustration of the utility that bank accounts provide: they can be safely used even by people who don't really know how they work. 

Crypto wallets are nothing like bank accounts. They are much more like *actual* wallets--only they usually contain way more money than you'd ever want to walk around with, and can potentially be robbed by invisible, anonymous thieves located anywhere in the world.

&gt;It's their credit cards that are stolen and companies they use get hacked and lose data.

You don't think that private keys are ever stolen?

The real difference is that when private keys are stolen, the rightful owner has no recourse. Victims of identity theft almost never permanently lose any money, because your bank is legally responsible for ensuring that unauthorized transactions are never carried out, and liable for any losses that occur when their security measures fail.

&gt;Also, these are anonymous systems that are immutable. [...] Rampant theft of private keys isn't going to be as big a deal as people think.

"I agree fully. Bash them all you like, you're free to do so. However, its clear to me that anyone saying ""fuck your greedy"" probably isn't considering the businesses' perspective and therefore isn't drawing a complete opinion.

I've been bashed here and there once I established myself and built my first company. I understand fully the bitterness of a young person who is struggling to get by with student loans, bad job opportunities, etc when I roll up in a brand new mercedes because my old one had a grain of leather I didnt like. I get it.

However, they weren't there when I had $10 to my name. When I hitchhiked to get to work. When I spent 5 years living in a mobile home living room with someone while I struggled to find a job. When I took the $2000/mo I finally was able to earn to pay off my debts and continued to live like a bum. They weren't there when I took the $5,000 I had saved and put it all on my first business venture. When I put every dime I made back into the business. They weren't there. I know their struggle so I have the full picture. Now that I have some security for the time being, you're goddamn right i'm going to enjoy it.

I took tremendous risk. Signed my name on endless personal guarantees. Signed myself into a lifetime of inescapable debt and ruin if I failed. I backed myself into a corner I couldn't escape but via one method: Success, and I did, at least for the time being.

So yea, the ATM operator is taking a shitload of risk paying $15k for a machine, and then anotehr $10k on bitcoin that could be worth 30% less the next day. He needs to ROI quickly. Theres no guarantee the ATM company itself will even be around this time next month. Those companies open and close like clockwork. The only way to run those machines is to ROI as fast as possible. If people are paying that 12% premium due to FOMO, of course he is going to charge it. The rule in business is to always charge what the market is willing to pay, so he's doing exactly what he should. He is under no obligation to offer a at-cost rate so Mr. OP can buy bitcoin for a low fee. Honestly, should he even be buying bitcoin if he is in such financial dire straights? Thats another argument entirely.

So criticize away, but it wont change anything. You want lower fees? Go support another ATM operator or buy on localbitcoins. ",1525948504
"I agree wallets should not have a default coin unless you set them up to do that. They should show all your balances or at least coin options on start up. I'd guess Bitcoin.com will get with the times on this issue eventually. I also think their wallet should show all the Bitcoin forks (worth over $1?) as well.

Of course, all the Bitcoin-core attacks on BCH make everyone who realizes what's happening feel like providing less support for BTC users even though it is not usually their fault BTC is run by and marketed by an evil group.",1525948473
"&gt; ""bitcoin core"" is not the rhetorical equivalent of ""bcash,"" that would be ""bcore""

I disagree strongly.  To me it seems the name ""bitcoin core"" (or ""bcore"" which is a simple shortening) has in it the main purpose to simultaneously conflate the software implementation of the bitcoin protocol currently known as ""bitcoin core"" (previously known as Bitcoin-Qt) with the protocol itself, and also to try to drive an artificial wedge between bitcoin the idea and bitcoin the implementation (the project known as Bitcoin Core being one of many compatible implementations).  

So on the one hand you've got Bitcoin (protocol) and Bitcoin Core (project) being synonymous.  And on the other hand you've got Bitcoin (idea) and Bitcoin (implementation - project and protocol) as being different.  It's actually rather clever.

You see, if you can get people to believe that ""bitcoin core"" is just another implementation of bitcoin the idea, and forget about the protocol part, then you can slide in sideways with your argument that bitcoin cash is just another implementation of bitcoin the idea.  And using that thin end of the wedge, you can then leverage the ""bitcoin cash is the real bitcoin"" argument, pushing bitcoin cash as the ""right"" implementation of the protocol, and have a vaguely self-consistent viewpoint if one squints and doesn't dig too deep.

So while you seem to be hung up on spelling, I see the insistence on calling Bitcoin ""bitcoin core"" for what it is.

And to be fair, ""bcash"" has the same (but opposite) purpose.  That purpose being to put as much distance between Bitcoin and bitcoin cash, drawing as much attention as possible to the fact that bitcoin cash is an altcoin.  If I wanted to be insulting, I'd call it ""btrash"".  To me ""bcash"" is what it is - the name of an altcoin that's trying to steal the name Bitcoin from the real bitcoin - the actual, real bitcoin, not Roger's ""real bitcoin"".

&gt; In any case, you are again raising emotional reactions as an issue.

You keep claiming that I'm talking about emotions here.  I did say I hate bcash in my op, however I think I've been relatively level headed and rational in everything else I've written in this conversation.  So I'm not sure what you're trying to get at here, it's almost like you want me to make irrational emotional arguments so that you can feel that you've got the more logical viewpoint.

The fact is, my support of Bitcoin is rational - as I stated above, as someone who cannot run a full node, but believes full nodes are a critical part of the network, I cannot support bitcoin cash.  Simultaneously, my dislike for bcash is also rational, based entirely on the public actions of Roger, Jihan and the other miners during the scaling debate/segwit activation time period.  I would ""hate"" dogecoin if the doge community tomorrow started saying ""doge is the real Bitcoin"".  As it stands, I don't give a shit about dogecoin.  I would truly like nothing more than to not give a shit about bitcoin cash, and I suspect a good number of Bitcoin supporters would feel the same way.",1525948459

"**Possession is nine-tenths of the law**

Possession is nine-tenths of the law is an expression meaning that ownership is easier to maintain if one has possession of something, or difficult to enforce if one does not. The expression is also stated as ""possession is nine points of the law"", which is credited as derived from the Scottish expression ""possession is eleven points in the law, and they say there are but twelve.""

Although the principle is an oversimplification, it can be restated as: ""In a property dispute (whether real or personal), in the absence of clear and compelling testimony or documentation to the contrary, the person in actual, custodial possession of the property is presumed to be the rightful owner. The rightful owner shall have their possession returned to them; if taken or used.

A big thing for me is the trust relationship required for such a transaction though. if it's a start up with no renown or institutional backing then I'm definitely not sending them bitcoins and hoping they make good. For that reason I went to a large New York based exchange to cash out before transferring into the stock account.

It took forever, almost 2 weeks between my sending the BTC to Gemini to sell and the cash being made available to trade on TD Ameritrade because of all the banking verification times. (Withdraw from Gemini to bank=5 days, deposit into TD Ameritrade account = 1+week to become available for spending)

"&gt; Maybe I'm wasting my time, but I still believe that the more data we have on this and related phenomena, the better we can exclude similar noise when building future communications platforms to serve the Bitcoin Cash community. 

You're wasting your time. People can only change opinions if they themselves decide to change, if you engage in a debate with someone and they start getting defensive, the debate might as well be over because it's not going anywhere. You've entered a feedback loop where they will defend their position more and more, and become more extreme about their own opinion in an emotional/irrational manner. You can see the same thing happening recently when the russians attacked social media to disrupt politics all over the world, they simply repeated the same extremist views over and over, and organically people started defending whatever side they happened to be on, started to get emotionally invested on that side and defending it more and more each time, resulting in all sides having very aggressive extremist views.

Your best bet is to state your opinion the best you can from the start, if they follow up with a defensive response simply don't reply. Hopefully they'll come across an event in the future that'll make them think, ""hey maybe u/KoKansei was right"" and change their own opinion on their own. The more you engage them in their misguided opinions, the harder it is to convince them to change it. 

The best way to detect when someone is being defensive, is when logical fallacies are used/mentioned. Repeating the same points with more details/rephrasing the same points is also a good indicator. If in doubt, simply don't reply.

This is a bit meta, but as an example I'm writing this reply only because you seemed to be open to the idea that you're wasting your time. If that didn't happen this reply wouldn't even exist.

To me, saying bcash is no different to the most recent tactic of referring to bitcoin as"" bitcoin core "". Difference is, I don't piss my pants or flip the bird every time someone says"" bitcoin core "".

The fact that certain bcash supporters find the term"" bcash ""to be an insult speaks volumes to me about their belief in their project. Personally I'm not worried that bcash will become"" the real bitcoin"", because I believe that bitcoin will have a use and value proposition no matter what bcash does. However it seems to me that the bcash supporters are not as confident about their project, and instead of marketing bcash as ""a better bitcoin"", they must try to push the ""the real bitcoin"" and ""satoshi's vision"" angle. And the term ""bcash"" takes what little leverage they have to try and promote their altcoin.

"If I'm not mistakened, you can cash out up to 1000 Euro in one transaction, and up to 300,000 Euro in one day

And yes, it works like a regular ATM (sort of). You select which coin you want to cash out, input your phone number to receive SMS notifications (which will be used to also verify your withdrawal), it prints you a ticket with a QR code, use the code (I used the Coinbase app) to send the funds to the address.

You'll receive an SMS that will inform you that they've received it and you'll be able to use that ticket again to be scanned by the ATM, use the number to verify it's you that you want to withdraw, and you'll get your funds. For this ATM, the minimum is 50 euros and the machine only gives out 50s and 100s.

It seems a lot of steps (and it is), but once you get it working, it's a pretty effortless thing. Nowhere near as fast as an ATM (overall time to convert LTC to Fiat would be about 20 minutes roughly), but still definitely a way to convert your crypto into cash.",1525943293

"The original proposal for LN was for micropayments, where even a 1-cent fee was too high.  Channels would be funded with up to $10 and spent in sub-cent increments.

LN started getting promoted to being **the** way to do any bitcoin transaction, not just the very small ones.

So now, instead of having channels be $10 and no one really risking much, it is being promoted as the only way anyone will ever use BTC.  ""Get paid on LN, use it on LN, never take it out of LN.""

We don't like being forced to use it.  We want on-chain transactions.  We want on-chain transactions to be viable and grow and let LN be used for the micropayments.  They can co-exist very well.

Forcing LN on everyone to escape the high on-chain fees on BTC means that there is immense pressure to make LN work and make it safe.  People will be risking much more than $10 on it.  Hubs have to be quite well funded.  Every piece of the LN system MUST work perfectly for it to succeed.

We wanted bigger blocks to allow LN to grow and mature, and relieve the pressure for it to have to be perfect from the start.  Now they are patching a payment network while it is being used.  There are many significant challenges to solve and implement while it has to keep working throughout.  No room for mistakes, otherwise lots of people lose money.",1525943187

&gt; 8.4    Payment Routing

&gt; It is theoretically possible to build a route map implicitly from observing
2-of-2 multisigs on the blockchain to build a routing table.  Note, however,
this is not feasible with pay-to-script-hash transaction outputs, which can
be resolved out-of-band from the bitcoin protocol via a third party routing
service.  Building a routing table will become necessary for large operators
(e.g.  BGP, Cjdns).  Eventually, with optimizations, the network will look a
lot like the correspondent banking network, or Tier-1 ISPs.  Similar to how
packets still reach their destination on your home network connection, not
all  participants  need  to  have  a  full  routing  table.   The  core  Tier-1  routes
can be online all the time —while nodes at the edges, such as average users,
would be connected intermittently.

Which is as good as admitting they have nothing.

But I'm sure [LN will be ready in 6 months](https://twitter.com/starkness/status/676599570898419712) Oh wait, this was in 2015...

"Say you post a QR code on a website, asking for $1 worth of bitcoin.  Many people send you $1.  You now have many transaction outputs of $1.  If you want to spend $5 worth, you have to spend 5 of those transactions (using 5 UTXO's).  

This requires your transaction to reference those 5 UTXOs and sign each one to prove ownership.  That uses space, and the fee is charged for each byte.  Spending more UTXO's costs more.

UTXO consolidation is simply sending many UTXO's to create a large transaction, sending it to a public address.  This receiving address now only contains that one UTXO to spend in the future.

On the BTC chain, since fees vary depending on how full the blocks are, you may be spending a significant amount in fees to consolidate.

On BCH, since the blocks are not full, the fees are always low, so the fee to write a massive transaction is also low.

Consolidating UTXO's when fees are cheap allows you to build smaller transactions when fees are expensive.

Even if the net amount you are sending (e.g. $5) is the same, the transaction sizes can vary greatly, depending on the number of UTXOs being spent.

I don't really blame the ATM operators, they have to cover the rent for the machine and the machines aren't cheap and often need repair, etc. Unless it's somehow a very high volume machine there's no way you can lower the fees by much.",1525941445

You're an idiot. You don't like what someone is charging? You go somewhere else, nobody is forcing you to use that ATM. They are under no obligation to offer you whatever *you* think is fair. 

There aren't many crypto ATM's right now so their fees are high. If you ran a bitcoin ATM you'd do the same. How the fuck do you expect a company to fund their ATM's when the value of what they're vending could drop 30% in a few hours? You're not buying from a goddamn exchange when you use those ATMs, they're pre-funded so the operator is incurring a ton of risk. For that risk, he is going to charge a premium.

Meanwhile, crybabies like you think everything should be offered up at cost or what *you* determine a fair price. You have no knowledge of how these things operate, you're only concerned with yourself and what you believe is fair without having all the information. 

So yea, do exactly what you said you'll do in your last sentence - don't give them your business. This is how a market works. When some competitor comes along with a lower rate, it'll force the other companies to come down in price until it no longer makes sense to operate those machines. Then people like you will bitch that there are no ATM's because there isn't enough profit in it to take the risk, then you'll cry about money being the only reason anyone does anything and people should just incur all that risk for no upside so you can buy bitcoin without fees. You're entitled and clueless. Go ask your mom to raise your allowance. I expect this type of whine from a person who is upset that their bank dumped them for ""too many withdraws and too few deposits..."". Thats how it works.

"Lots of things. Just one simple example: it's considered property...but are other cryptocurrencies treated solely as property or also ""financial instruments"" or a commodity? That affects whether your investing expenses are deductible against the net investment tax. Because if it's a ""financial instrument"" or even a commodity you can deduct all your costs incurred trying to trade them (like a computer workstation you buy) from the net investment tax but if it's considered only ""property"" you can't. While a lot of us THINK of Bitcoin and crypto as commodities and financial instruments the IRS has never actually stated this, they've only stated that it's property.

Another example are how to treat forks/airdrops/etc. If some fork comes out and it's only traded on some BS exchange in the middle of nowhere that US citizens don't have access to, what's the real value of that fork? Is it really $0 because you can't actually cash it out, or do you owe tons of income tax just because some crackpot exchange with $500 of volume a day has the price of the fork sky high? Especially if the fork is being pumped and dumped when it gets airdropped and dubious futures on dubious exchanges are in play, do you end up owing tons of income tax on these forks? Do you only owe taxes on forks if you claim them or will the [IRS claim that you had access to it so you owe taxes?](https://www.bitcointaxsolutions.com/yes-bitcoin-hardford-is-taxable-income-heres-why/)

"Can you really blame them? The vast majority of crypto ads are for straight up scams. Bitconnect gained much of its traction running ads on YouTube. So did Davorcoin. It's a massive stream of trash, and they can't possibly investigate every ICO or crypto company and try to determine how legit they are.

Honestly, if I were in their position, I would do the same thing. And as supporters of crypto, we're probably better off for it. Public perception of cryptocurrency would take a nasty hit if you just opened those floodgates.",1525939395
"Nice try but no... there is only 1 Bitcoin blockchain now, and that is Bitcoin Cash BCH. The other one is artificially crippled blockchain, by people who are funded (read controlled) by the bankers, which want to force people that own BTC to not use it (as there is now simply not enough ""room"" for everyone) and force them into completely different system, one that is not even a blockchain, called Lightning.

Bitcoin Cash is only real working Bitcoin.

"SPV clients will have to connect to SPV servers, correct.

Bitcoin Cash doesn't hide the fact that for millions or billions of users, we'll need high-powered nodes, which is what we already have in the form of miners, and which BTC also needs.

LN on the other hand is highly complicated, will most likely have much bigger bandwidth needs if routing is to be decentralised or will need centralised hubs. So there is really no advantage compared to the simple BCH solution of on-chain scaling along with SPV clients.

And back on topic, if BTC developers weren't able to optimize the wallet code, how can we trust them in being able to scale the BTC network?",1525939358
"In my opinion, I don't think that even covers it appropriately. I think what happens is that the blockchain gets cloned. It goes from one blockchain, to two 100% identical blockchains, that run in parallel back 9 years (in the case of BTC and BCH). 

Then the people who run the two clones both made changes. The changes to BTC were far more drastic and extensive than the changes made to the BCH chain. ",1525939332

"Bitcoin hard cap is a real problem, it causes the price to rise through scarcity.  Hold on you think, isn't that what I as an investor want?
Perhaps for a while, but it stops Bitcoin from becoming a currency because hardly anyone ever wants to spend it.

Coins that have no cap in total circulation, but still have an inflexible issuance rate are much more suitable to become global currencies because new entrants can always get coins. However note that the % new issuance decreases each year as a function of total supply, so they are still deflationary, but on a much slower curve.

Becoming a global currency, holds way more future value than being a limited supply investment vehicle.",1525939192

"Sorry if I wasn't clear with my intent here. I was mostly just flabbergasted with the complete lack of respect for basic logic by one of the most prolific core trolls in /r/bitcoinmarkets. He took the initiative to PM me after an exchange in that sub, and I continued to talk with him, discovering in the process that he lacked the very basic fundamentals of logical rigor in a way that even exceeded my expectations.

It turns out that he apparently lost his entire double digit BTC stack getting fleeced by more competent market agents.

http://traynews.com/blog/how-i-lost-nearly-200-bitcoin/

Had I known this beforehand I would not have even engaged him. The point of posting our exchange was not to start a debate but rather to create a public record of the kind of empty rhetorical games played by the biggest losers in this space and to highlight a particularly egregious case of someone capable of going on endlessly without actually engaging in good-faith discussion.

In this particular case I now think that this person is not trolling deliberately, but is quite disturbed and probably not very bright. It is important to realize that these are the type of people who have aligned themselves with the farcical core narrative. Maybe I'm wasting my time, but I still believe that the more data we have on this and related phenomena, the better we can exclude similar noise when building future communications platforms to serve the Bitcoin Cash community.

Obviously it's got scarcity mastered but anyone arguing that bitcoin doesn't have an use value simply hasn't thought through the usefulness of incredible concepts like hard money, freedom from the banks, uncensorable payments, machine payments &amp; micropayments, contract-based payments, etc. You can't put a value on this big enough.

"That really sucks.

But I think this highlights that there is huge and misguided overconfidence across the community in the myth that cryptocurrency is  ""more secure"" than the modem fiat banking system. Security isn't just about clever maths and tech like hashing, asymmetric crypto, distributed verification and so on. It's also about all the surrounding banking processes, regulation and consumer protection that comes into play when normal people make genuine mistakes (like losing a credit card or getting malware on their computer) and get defrauded as a result. I don't know about our countries but in the UK we have full protection from banking fraud including if an unauthorised person obtains your password (which is why banks enforce two factor auth to setup new payees).
