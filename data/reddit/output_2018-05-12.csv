"Established platforms will have a good chance of survival. Eth will do fine. Iota will survive as well. First mover in DAG and plenty use cases for iot. I'm afraid btc will also survive, simply because it's bitcoin. Privacy coins like monero might be outlawed one day but I am confident at least monero will survive as well. For utility tokens the one with the strongest use cases and rapid adoption will survive, impossible to say which ones though. I also expect older projects to last over new ones with similar use cases simply because it's getting harder to maintain a market position in crypto. Just my 0.02$",1526194675

"not bitcoins fault. blame it on the shit tokens and shit ico's. 

who's gonna use a smart contract that can only call upon digitized data extracted from a source.. from a website? a database? do multiple sources need to be used? even so, the source in itself is digitized, can be manipulated and cant be trusted. so many things can go wrong..especially if you need PROOF of work done. You can forget about smart contracts. This is not world of warcraft where you kill a critter and get loot. Furthermore, no businesses will use ETH to transact value, especially not for smart contracts since they're not real time. The only way around this is to preload the smart contract with Eth to convert to fiat. What a headache.

Speaking of preloading, this concept is also a flaw in say a smart contract for paying rent monthly. The Eth needs to be ""locked up"" in the smart contract. Who's gonna put 1 years worth of rent locked up in a smart contract as Eth. Forget about living expenses for a year? There is no friggin mortgage on Eth, ok?

You add in all the ico's \(again cue buzzword erc 20 smart contracts dadada for the ease of recognition of tokens by other exchanges\). so these tokens get traded for money before they even have any actual valuein the blockchain they're in. They actually have to think up a use case for the token. Get that?? \(e.g Ontology\). Why dont you just create a private blockchain like hashgraph. Oh wait. Have to 2x 5x the Ico, forgot about that. And honestly why the fuck create another coin called GAS, all this bullshit about needing another coin to ""drive"" the blockchain and rights to whatever bullshit voting rights. 

Its no wonder why Vitalik proposes 1500 Eth to stake for PoW, and no wonder why he wants to cap the supply of Eth. All Eth is doing is a money grab and perpetuating icos and tokens to do the same. The agenda is all the same, bullshit some whitepaper, get the money first then figure out how to drag and tweet more bullshit.

Eth has spread their cancer to exchanges.

Actual tokens that have real use are being boycotted by exchanges. Token like Locktrip is only listed on hitbtc, and it actually cuts 20&amp;#37; from hotel bookings vs expedia, [bookings.com](https://bookings.com) etc.

It took me a year to realize exchanges are just a giant casino. But the whole world wants to gamble. It really took me some time to read through the bullshit and the ""tech"".

So if we withdraw to crypto, it's instant, it's safe, but it's subject to market fluctuation. 

Then if we can withdraw the USD to our wallet, it will be instant and readily available for getting back into the market.

With Bitcoin Cash the user has some control over his privacy.

If a Bitcoin Cash user needs more privacy they can simply shapeshift their coins in the Monero and then later shapeshift back. (or any other website that does this). It's good that Monero exists, for people that need to be completely invisible. ",1526193903

No ideological position is being taken in this decision, merely a business position that more profit is better than less.

"Lets consider the following two networks:

A: There are 5 miners who run a full node. Everybody else runs a SPV node.  
B: There are 5 miners who run a full node. Everybody else also runs a full node.

Suppose that you are an evil actor in network A and want to create more bitcoins than the 21m limit allows. Easy peasy. Make a deal with the miners, and you're done. The general public isn't able to detect that more than 21m bitcoins exists. If breaking the 21m limit is too radical, how about stealing satoshi's coins? Also easy. SPV clients cannot detect any of this.

Now suppose that you are an evil actor in network B. Now you're stuck, if you want to create more than 21m bitcoin or steal satoshi's coins, you'll have to convince the miners and the vast majority of the network to update to your software.

It is obvious that network B is more secure than network A. The conclusion is that every additional full node on the network improves network security by some degree.

You don't have to trust full nodes. You only have to trust that *some* full nodes are willing to keep *themselves* secure. You never have to trust them directly. Unless you run a SPV node, then you're trusting a full node directly...",1526193641

For me, segwit still alters the nature of a Bitcoin transaction, whether or not as you basically say “it still performs the same as a Bitcoin transaction, just in a different way”.

Obviously I need to get more familiar with the technicality of this aspect of the Bitcoin protocol, but at face value, segregated witness alters the foundation of the Bitcoin protocol and to me that’s more in line with an altcoin.

You'll be amazed as soon as we get 51% of price (and by that stage we'd assume over 50% of hash) just how quickly it will all come around and it will suit all parties to forget about the failed BCore experiment and rewrite history that Bitcoin was always the coin without segshit.",1526191315
"The distribution of whales will change as soon as one coin replaces Bitcoin by probably IOTA, Skycoin or Elastos.  There's been spread lots of FUD about these coins about minor things, while their technology is simply vastly superior and Bitcoin has jarring problems, such as the only thing protecting it is the security to physical access to Bitmain. \(If someone or a group can gain physical access within Bitmain to their mining pools, be it through coercion, blackmail or hacking they can already launch a 40&amp;#37; attack, which almost has a 90&amp;#37;\+ chance to succeed and cash out through the following fork, altcoins or other means.\)

Currently, 20&amp;#37; of the whole crypto market is owned by 160 Bitcoin addresses. Once Bitcoin is replaced, 40&amp;#37; of the entire crypto market will be owned by the Bitcoin whales who put most of their holdings in the winner of the above 3.  However, there are probably only a few whales who do that. 

So, within the next year, there will probably be 5 ex\-bitcoin whales who own 20&amp;#37; of IOTA in total and possibly 5&amp;#37; of the entire crypto market, much better than the current 20&amp;#37; of the crypto market.

P.S. People always get very angry when I explain how vulnerable Bitcoin is to a 40&amp;#37; attack and possibly to a 75&amp;#37; attack, since Bitmain is also an investor in the 3rd largest mining pool, but they can never give an argumen how it can be prevented except that it all depends on Bitmain's security.

"&gt;Sorry that’s what I meant, not that the coin was worthless, just less valuable than a Bitcoin. Which in itself differentiates a segwitcoin from a Bitcoin.

Except that a miner is no more required to observe witness data to collect fees on bitcoin than they are on segwit. They only need enough information to exclude transactions which spend previously-spent coins (according to the chain they're extending). That does not require witness data.

&gt;Honest question, what does this mean for economic incentive regarding mining of segwit coins?

The same thing as it does for bitcoin (in reality) - the best economic outcome is to only build directly on blocks you have personally validated. Building on blocks which cannot be validated risks not just the reward and fees earned from the next block discovered, but from every block that extends the nonvalidated chain and, ultimately, all coins of the chain should the market lose faith.",1526191146

"Bits are not an intuitive division. If you told me you had 3 bits of bitcoin I would have to ask how much that was. If you said you had 30 millibitcoin I would understand perfectly that you had 0.03 bitcoin. In fact if I had to guess I would imagine that 1 bit of bitcoin = 0.125 bitcoin, as a bit is a ""piece of eight"" historically.


We still refer to a unit of fiat as a ""buck"", even though the price has nothing to do with that of a deer pelt. And I say unit of fiat because we do it in my currency as well, not just the US Dollar it originated from. It denotes a unit rather than a value. People will find their own names for sensible divisions given the value in that particular time and place.


Imagine the difference between Norway and Ethiopia, both using the same currency. It might be sensible to call a millibitcoin a bit in Norway, but that could be a week's wage in Ethiopia. They might refer to a microbitcoin as a bit.


So to sum up it's not intuitive and people will just make up a sensible division and call it whatever they want anyway. In the mean time we should be explicit about it by using the approriate metric prefix. And yes people do know what they mean, it's a very common and standard thing that we should all know. 1kg = 1000g, 1ms = 0.001s, 1GHz = 1,000,000,000Hz. 1BTC = 1000mBTC. And soon enough we can just say B. 1B = 1000mB = 1,000,000uB",1526190775
"Ah ok. I understand now. Thank you for the clarification.  
  
Now, in regards to this, I like the idea of people being able to run their own non mining full nodes (ie bitcoin core's definition of full node). After all, the whole point of bitcoin and crypto is decentralization and removal of trust. If I'm able to run my own node, then I don't have to trust *anyone* to make sure transactions are valid. In fact, I'd argue that Satoshi's mention of ""1 cpu 1 vote"" in the original white paper together with all nodes being assumed to be what we call mining nodes now suggests that Satoshi simply didn't expect gpu, fpga and asic mining (that lead to centralization) and just expected everyone to be running a full node that both validated and mined. What I'm trying to say is that if he had been able to predict this, he probably would have still suggested people to run their own non mining nodes even though they can't run the originally planned node (mining node). This is speculation on my part. Afterall, if he expected everyone to be running a mining node, it's not too far fetched to assume that he'd still recommend the next best thing available after mining become inaccesible to most people (just a validating node).  
  
I do admit that I'm not convinced 100% that this is how it would have played out. The main problem I find with this reasoning is that Satoshi also mentions in chapter 8 of the white paper *Simplified Payment Verification*, that it is possible to verify payments without running a ""full network node"", which I understand to be what we call full node now. Nonetheless, this is still running a node albeit a light version of it.",1526190663

"There's no tax on winning at pokies when you win, but there are huge taxes for the house when it wins. It's a situation of: people are going to gamble regardless, so might as well make it legal and collect most of their losses, so we can use that to support them when they need welfare. I don't think it's a valid comparison, because of the addiction aspect at play. It's more comparable to alcohol/nicotine/drugs.

But even if we allow the comparison, then consider who is the ""house"" in the crypto-trading scenario. When you lose money, some other investor gains money. That means the people who turn a profit are the ""house"", and need to be taxed heavily, just as the pokie companies are.

The little guys who cannot invest a lot should not be investing in high-risk assets. No financially sound investment strategy will recommend allocating more than 10% (at _most_) of a portfolio into high-risk assets.

In this model, consensus is expressed through the activity known as mining, not through inactive nodes that keep backs of the transaction history but do not do mining, but chain splits are possible and legitimate (freedom of association), and both miners and non-miners (whether passive nodes or users using SPV wallets) are free to choose to participate in one chain or another.",1526186313

"&gt; When P = 0 segwitcoin is worth nothing. 

This equation is presented as the _value of signatures_ not the value of the coin. As invalid as the original argument is, your explanation still ends up being _less valid_. 

Rewind and consider Peter's argument.

&gt; The previous owners' digital signatures have significantly less value to a miner for segwit coins than for bitcoins because miners do not require them to claim fees.

There is a hidden  corollary to this claim - that miners _do_ require signatures for bitcoins in order to claim fees. Peter supports this difference with the previously covered ability to update UTXO: segwit permits this while bitcoin (it is claimed) does not. However, as we've discussed, an miner need never worry about accidentally including a previously mined transaction for which they have not observed signatures as they would not include an unvalidated transaction in the first place. The only risk to profitability is againt a majority willing to blindly signal their acceptance of non-validated transactions - a dishonest majority against which neither chain can stand.

Back to the equation. What does this really show? As the probability that a transaction is invalid approaches zero, the value of its signatures approaches zero for segwit and approaches the fee earned for bitcoin. Let's grant this assumption for the moment. What happens when the probability that a transaction is invalid increases? Suddenly the value of a signature to a segwit coin grows substantially faster than it does for a bitcoin! Failing to validate the previous block greatly increases the probability that it is invalid, increasing the value of signatures.

Of course the whole thing is flawed. Since we know that an otherwise-honest bitcoin miner can include any transactions he's seen in a block built on top of a previous block he has not validated or even fully witnessed, so long as he has enough information to avoid double spending, there is no difference between the two. The only time a miner cannot reliably include transactions in his new block is when he cannot uniquely identify the outpoints spent in the previous blocks. This is true of both segwit and bitcoin! Neither strictly requires that he observe the witness data if he doesn't care to validate it, just so long as he can be sure not to include transactions spending previously-spent coins.",1526184758

Both are slang anyway, the concept of ""bits"" is only newer. It's not really confusing as to which fork people are referencing to either, in the end there's just going to be one fork anyway.

Just like I don't think we should differentiate BCH too much by using a green logo I don't think we should start changing units. BCH is Bitcoin and all that.

For those claiming that it's confusing because bits are already ""in use"" as a measurement of information, a lot of things have the same name in life but anyone can figure out the meaning from context. Especially if you write it like for example ""199.00 bits"".",1526183991

There are currently no ASICs mining on Vertcoin ATM either, I should rephrase, it is highly unlikely. Also, given that the developers have hardforked once and were successful it is going to deter any ASIC manufacturer from spending the R&amp;D to design an ASIC for Vertcoin. What if we run out of algorithms to hardfork? Or what if the community grows so big that it becomes harder to successfully get people onto the new chain? Those are real possibilities. What has to happen now is the hash power for vertcoin needs to keep increasing with time to the point where developing an ASIC would not add much monetary gain (if that's possible?) As the deterrent from forking is there already.

There is also the simple solution that more ASIC manufacturers will get in the game which I hope happens for Bitcoin and Litecoin's sake...but it is not the reality rn, there are only 2 or 3 ASIC manufacturers that are offering real products? The ASICs are also proprietary which is incredibly bad practice for decentralization...it would be like running Bitcoin nodes on Visa's servers...or in large data centers which I believe is where most Bitcoin nodes are running due to the blockchain being so large....a lot of different complexities here.",1526183290

So for Blockstream to come out of nowhere with the best cryptographers and an insane budget coming from investors like AXA (tied to Bilderberg group/current financial monopoly). In combination with the nonsensical decisions to keep the blocksize cap in favor for some nonexistent technology at the time (LN), effectively stunting the growth of Bitcoin, I read between the lines that it seems as if this is an attempt to control/destroy the original BTC as we know it from the inside out.

"**EOS.IO**

EOSIO is a cryptocurrency token and blockchain that claims to operate as a smart contract platform for the deployment of decentralized applications and decentralized autonomous corporation.

EOSIO aims to become a decentralized operating system supporting industrial-scale applications, with claims to eliminate transaction fees and also conduct millions of transactions per second.

**White paper**

A white paper is an authoritative report or guide that informs readers concisely about a complex issue and presents the issuing body's philosophy on the matter. It is meant to help readers understand an issue, solve a problem, or make a decision.

The initial British term concerning a type of government-issued document has proliferated, taking a somewhat new meaning in business. In business, a white paper is closer to a form of marketing presentation, a tool meant to persuade customers and partners and promote a product or viewpoint.

Contentious, perhaps, but neither Segwit nor RBF drastically change the consensus framework or security model of bitcoin.

Warping the discussion on Segwit and RBF as technical failures has undermined BCH's ability to show how both would be better on a big-blocks chain.

"Lol, dude, let me guess; the 1MB blocksize cap, segregating the signature data, full blocks, high fees, slow transaction times, “store of value” and the implementation of (nonexistent at the time) complex unfinished Lightning Network, rather than follow SN’s directions of a proven simple method of raising the blocksize is the reasons why BTC has consensus.

If BTC had true consensus, BCH would cease to exist.

The whole store of value narrative goes completely against the original Bitcoin protocol. BTC did not become what it is today with this whole “hodl narrative” it was never meant to be an investment vehicle, it was meant to be peer-to-peer electronic cash - to be spent.

&gt;altcoins are not the reason btc has consensus 

Due to the above-mentioned conditions, other than being the main altcoin gateway, there is no other incentive to use BTC.

With that said, I stand firm on my opinion that BTC being the number 1 altcoin gateway, due to its inception of being the first of its kind (pre-segwit), is the only reason it has the hash power consensus that it has today. Miners will mine based upon economic incentive, not politics.",1526176074

"I wasn't advocating for a lower block time or a higher block time, I was just trying to explain the thought process that ya gotta go thru when looking at changing the block time

Litecoin also sees a fraction of what Bitcoin handles on a daily basis, so we don't know if a scaled network would run into problems

Also, BCH currently has lower fees. The minimum fee relay amount for litecoin is 0.001 LTC/KB, where as the BCH will confirm 1 sat/byte transactions

For a standard 1 input 1 output transaction it's 226 bytes

Litecoin: 0.226 kb * 0.001 LTC/kb * $140 = $0.0316 in fees

Bitcoin Cash: 226 bytes * 1 sat/byte / 100,000,000 (divide by this to convert satoshis to BCH) * $1460 = $0.0033 in fees

With bch roughly priced x10 higher than LTC, it still processes transaction with a tenth of the fees

"I don't think it would be would be a disaster, but like I said, people would become less willing to take on risk. This can be good, but of course at the cost of increasing the global economy more rapidly. Modest inflation is good for the economy. High rates of unchecked inflation on the other hand, is a symptom of a poorly run country. Bitcoin or other fixed price currencies cannot fix or prevent bad economic decisions made by leaders.

Moreover, even after 10 years of QE since the Great Recession, we have yet to see inflation. So it would appear that even mass printing can have little effect on inflation, which is admittedly somewhat bizarre. ",1526175889

"I don't see how this makes any sense at this point. Both chains are separate entities now existing together, which share the same pool of hardware. Usually the lesser hashpower side would just die completely as miners convert to the newer version of the protocol, but in a political fork that is not the case, much like the BCH DAA was altered to force the minority hashpower side to continue living in protest.

It was decided at the time of the fork that ""Bitcoin"" is the one with the most hash power, so that is how it went down.  But if  BCH gained more hashpower than BTC overnight, the space would call Bitcoin Cash just *Bitcoin*, and BTC would be Bitcoin Core then as a minority chain assuming the diff change didn't just kill it?  I don't see any version of reality that would play out that way, or would not be a complete disaster for both networks in the resulting confusion after another IP war.

Determining the rights to the Bitcoin title by hashpower seems to have some logical fallacies, because it only really works *forward only* to decide which side of a PoW fork is retains the original naming convention. Once it is done there isn't any going back, BCH and BTC are now distinct entities with a common ancestor that no longer exists. 

All that said, you're right, it really doesn't matter now. We should just focus on proving the original Bitcoin roadmap was the best one by just doing it in the field, and embracing Bitcoin Cash's identity as the *Bitcoin you're supposed to actually use* just like the project started out to be.  Bitcoin Cash should now and always be Bitcoin Cash to identify its distinct lineage and mission, I think rolling back to just *Bitcoin* would be kind of insulting to everyone who worked so hard and long get us here.

"&gt; You also seem like quite the hypocrite since the only points you've made lean towards trying to discourage people from investing in BTC, yet you say you want to see it become a currency.

No. You are completely wrong. My stance is of a person who does not want to see users to see their investment disappear, which may still happen if people continue with this HODLER nonsense.

&gt; Bitcoin needs support and early adoption from financial institution and private individuals before it can ever stand a chance of becoming a currency. 

That's pure BS. For Bitcoin to succeed as a currency, it needs to be used as such and for that to happen, it needs people spending it on products, not HODLING for life! **Bitcoin does not need the help of the same institutions that fucked up the global economy. Asking Wall Street to make bitcoin great, is like asking a paedophile to babysit a child.**

Hodlers only help in one thing. To make sure scarcity is created in the market, so that whalers control the rallies and dips of the market and take their profit out of the market by safely shorting Bitcoin. Control the supply of the market and you control the market itself.

&gt; You can already see an example of what happens as the price goes up by looking back at the history of BTC. The more it goes up, yes people sell but this is offset by the amount of attention and new adopters gained by each increase.

[Hot-hand fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hot-hand_fallacy) - *The sometimes fallacious belief a person who experiences success with a random event has a greater probability of further success in additional attempts.*

Listen to me. I have read several times, naive users of this sub, that stated the same thing over and over - *""this has happened before. There was also the crash from 1K to 300""*...
**No! There was never a crash equally damaging like the crash of January - Febuary**. That crash removed billions from the Bitcoin economy. There was **never** a moment of the Bitcoin history were a crash took that much money out of the system! 

Watch the price value and you will notice that instability and volatility in the Bitcoin market surged after the crash. This is terrible for Bitcoin. Instability is not good for something that is supposed to be a currency! If you want adoption like I want, then you do not want instability.

"1. It's most profitable to mine bitcoin in areas where the electricity supply is underutilized, and therefore the pricing should be appropriately lower to attract more power consumers. 
That alone offsets most of the bitcoin is killing the planet nonsense, as most of those regions are hydropowered. But even if not other areas that might be powered by nuclear or coal and underutilized, those kind of plants are base load plants and can't be dialed up or down in production so often power is literally wasted if not used, as you can't dump infinite power in the grid, the voltage would spike and blow up your shit!

2. How much environmental damage does a bank office cause. Asphalt for the parking spaces, employees burning gas to get to work, air conditioning, the computers they use to conduct business, etc...  What's the environmental impact of building the building. 

Anyway, they whole thing is dumb, electric companies charge a rate for electricity and they connect to your building with like 100 AMP rated connection, as long as you pay the bill and don't exceed the 100 AMPs they provisioned for you, it's nobodies business how much electricity al gore uses for his 20000 foot house, or ummm I mean.... how much electricity you use to mine crypto.

You need to think of this like Kodak. It was around for 100 years making a fortune off of film.  It even invented the digital camera but its leadership did not believe in the digital camera.  Bitcoin could be around for a long time or be replaced by some coin that really catches on.  That coin may not even be on the market yet.

Opportunity cost is a very real thing. 20k in Bitcoin or 20k for your kid in college? 200k in Bitcoin or 200k in real estate?

When you're 18, 100% is likely not more than a few thousand at most. Losing that is not a big deal relatively speaking.

When you're 50, 100% is likely tens of thousands and losing that could be catastrophic. For example, my father lost funeral savings for my grandparents, my sister's college fund, and a down payment on a condo when crypto crashes in january. He was 50% in against my countless warnings.

If a person's risk tolerance is +/- 10% and a bunch of whales can sell and buy their own coin (illegal in fiat) that is forcing them to sell based on inaccurate information... is the market really dropping or is it insider trading? You can say force is only wage garnishing or imprisonment or barrel of a gun and Bitcoin does not do that, but you can always renounce your citizenship and walk out so we are only arguing about where the line is.

You can laugh and talk about weak hands and dumb asses all you want, but to make an informed decision you need all the knowledge. So if Bitcoin became the ""world currency"" it would a) be forcing people to use it b) be forcing people to accept a risk tolerance of + / - huge amounts.

I like Bitcoin the way it is now (and actually think it's a good idea to buy 1 and hodl if you got spare cash) but to say Bitcoin would not impose anything on others if it replaced fiat money... a fantasy. It would impose the will of those early whales on everyone else.

"Theres two things to think about when considering block time

The first is risk of orphan blocks. With a lower block time, it's more likely that miners produce a block at nearly the same time, resulting in one miners block getting orphaned. If miners around the world have varying internet speeds (which is true) then this can lead to mining centralization in areas of better internet connection

Each time a block is produced, the ledger is updated. Changing the ledger is absurdly difficult, but not impossible. It can be done via a 51% attack, when one party has a majority of the hash rate. If the attacker has literally almost half of the hash rate, the honest chain and the attacking chain will both increase at the same rate, allowing most SPV wallets to stick with the main chain. The rate they increase will be have the rate as before, as half the hash rate is mining each chain.

Some say that a transaction is completely 100% confirmed after 6+ confirmation on the Bitcoin network. Let's say youre a business owner and someone buys a product. They send you a transaction and it gets confirmed and at that moment, the attacker starts mining a dishonest chain. Let's say the customers transaction gets picked up and confirmed in a block on the dishonest chain, and immediately after the attacker finds another block. The honest chain still hasn't produced a block since the transaction was broadcasted. This means the dishonest chain is now the longest chain and seen as the valid chain by SPV/Lite wallets.

It's already ridiculously unlikely that one person accumulates 51% of the hash power, and if someone was able to get any more than that would make bitcoin a failed system. Since it's pretty close to half, each chain would be just as likely to progress. The issue is when the ""bad"" chain gets lucky for a few blocks before over taken by the main chain. Some guy did the probability of a dishonest miner producing lots of blocks in a row and past 6 it's basically impossible.

With lower block time coins, a dishonest miner can get lucky more often and can go on longer streaks of lucky blocks, opening up a possible attack vector.

That's at least my understanding of the factors that go into blocksize, if I'm wrong about anything please correct me

"&gt;If the Congress keeps spending money and the debt keeps growing another country will become the major reserve currency like the dollar did to the pound. China is trying to do that now.

You do know what precipitated this, correct?

When DC and NY are rubble from the air raids like London was post-WWII we can consider that option....

&gt;The problem with Bitcoin is it can be replaced by another crypto people like to use better. Right now Bitcoin has two major uses. One is the gateway coin but it is losing that place as more exchanges allow other coins to move around in the crypto world. The second is if some other crypto catches on and is used to buy things like a credit/debt card will Bitcoin lose its place. It only has the value people think it has today and tomorrow. What value will it have when people have moved on to a coin that is easier and maybe cheaper to use. Not saying Bitcoin has a great place right now but will it have value in 10 years if no one is using it except as a store of value.

Yes, this is very interesting and hard to tell what will happen. Obviously as an open source software anyone can make as many new coins as they want relatively easily but some will actually be useful and will succeed. I don't know which, why or when - but some will succeed.

Forecasting 10 years in bitcoin has to be impossible. Shits been around for 10 and went from $0.00001 to over $20,000.00 back down to $6,000.00.

The biggest problem crypto has in the US right now is the taxes if you use it like a currency.  You will pay additional taxes every time you use a crypto to buy anything else.  The only time is it not taxed is when you move it.  VISA is developing a crypto coin if it catches on and can be used like a VISA credit or debit card that could quickly replace Bitcoin.  Everything only has the value that people put on it.  Gold was down at $350 at the turn of the century when it turned around hit about $1900 and is now at $1300.

In general, there are coins that are very sensitive to the price movement of BTC (e.g. VEN, ICX, TRX, Nano) and there are those that are somewhat insensitive or seemingly have delays (e.g. XMR, XLM, WTC).  So if there is an uptick in the BTC, the first group will move up quickly first while the second group stagnates.  However, if you move your profits from the 1st group to the 2nd group, even if BTC dips again, the 2nd group's coins will likely be more stable while the 1st group's coin will dip/correct.

"Not really. Bitcoin is not imposing anything upon others. ""Crony capitalism"" requires an authority. One who imposes rule by force. This force has the power to choose what business can succeed and fail.

Bitcoin is not immune from such a system existing, but it is not this system. If an authority does not exist then free market decides, and every individuals inclusion is voluntary. Bitcoin removes an enormous amount of the control an authority typically has today. Early hodlers of bitcoin would not have power over new coins distribution or able to allow or block individuals from using bitcoin. We could speculate how these individuals might act once they have that much financial power, but maybe some research into how to retain multi generational wealth could give insight. The families that are in close to absolute financial power in the world today did not accidentally fall into place, they have a specific way to retain the wealth over generations that others have been unable to do.

"these articles about energy expenditure always mention energy used per transaction, and this article is no different.  while it mentions that the cumulative energy expenditure is what keeps the blockchain secure, the article fails to connect the dots and say that energy used for today’s mining secures all transactions, both new and historic, against tampering.  every block, regardless of how many transactions it contains, raises the total cumulative block height and therefore increases the energy required to fork/attack/re-write the blockchain.  
  
and i disagree that the lightning network has anything to do with the energy usage of mining.  it’s completely unrelated.  
  
and more efficient mining hardware won’t reduce the total energy used by mining.  more efficient hardware will just allow miners to run more mining hardware.
  
it’s definitely a huge concern that bitcoin miners will be consuming a lot of green energy.  maybe a silver lining is that perhaps bitcoin will spur faster adoption of renewable energy sources.  but at some point something’s gotta give.  perhaps a huge price collapse will decrease the electricity demand for mining long enough for alternative blockchain security models to be investigated, or cause a migration to some other coin.

"The dollar has already lost 95% of its value since becoming the major reserve currency.  If the Congress keeps spending money and the debt keeps growing another country will become the major reserve currency like the dollar did to the pound.  China is trying to do that now.  

The problem with Bitcoin is it can be replaced by another crypto people like to use better.  Right now Bitcoin has two major uses. One is the gateway coin but it is losing that place as more exchanges allow other coins to move around in the crypto world.  The second is if some other crypto catches on and is used to buy things like a credit/debt card will Bitcoin lose its place.  It only has the value people think it has today and tomorrow.  What value will it have when people have moved on to a coin that is easier and maybe cheaper to use.  Not saying Bitcoin has a great place right now but will it have value in 10 years if no one is using it except as a store of value.  ",1526167186
Why do you hate bitcoin?,1526167166
"
&gt;They reached an average of $28 dollars per transaction while confirmation times slowed to a snail’s pace. 

Since you're repeating the same lies from earlier, I'll repeat the same truths: the average time between blocks has pretty much always been just under ten minutes; see [this chart](https://data.bitcoinity.org/bitcoin/block_time/all?f=m10&amp;t=l) for a clearer picture of this.

If you mean that ""confirmation times for transactions that were not paying competitive fee-rates"", then the truth of the matter is that those times stayed relatively constant, too. The competitive fee-rates *did* rise in value (demand exceeded supply), though after a couple of months these values have returned to ""normal"" levels and are [currently around the same sat/byte levels seen in the ""Bitcoin pretender coin""](https://fork.lol/tx/fee).

&gt;At the beginning of January, the damage was felt across the ecosystem as the price collapsed and the whole cryptocurrency market felt the reverberations. In March, CNBC wrote that bitcoin retraced 70% of its value since the start of the crash.

If only [this was a pattern observed *years* ago](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1q41wq/the_bitcoin_hype_cycle/) which has been [thoroughly analyzed and dissected](https://medium.com/@mcasey0827/speculative-bitcoin-adoption-price-theory-2eed48ecf7da) plenty of times by now... oh wait...

&gt;It is true that bitcoin’s price has collapsed as much or more in the past

Oh, so the whole ""evil developers trying to sabotage it"" explanation doesn't exactly hold any water?

&gt;but this particular collapse has been partly blamed on the “scaling debate” and high fees that plagued bitcoin.

A lot of things have been blamed on a lot of other things. That's not really a good argument. I could just as well say ""You personally caused the last collapse"" and my argument would be just as valid as yours is here (i.e. *not at all valid*).

&gt;Truth and Divisiveness

&gt;It is not known whether the Core team, including Blockstream, purposely undermined bitcoin.

It's quite well known that anyone trying to argue that they did anything of the sort is a very unintelligent (or possibly malicious) person.

&gt;Still, well known people like Jeff Berwick have suggested Blockstream was compromised, because they were bought out by AXA Insurance.

Nice appeal-to-authority attempt, but [this has been pretty thoroughly refuted](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/84w9ue/the_reason_for_twitters_censorship_of_bch_related/dvtmc5m/).

&gt;Berwick goes on to say the head of AXA is the same person who heads the Bilderberg group. According to Berwick, it appears that central bankers bought out Bitcoin in order to destroy it or hamstring it.

Well, Berwick isn't too bright, then, now is he?

&gt;In a Dollar Vigilante article Berwick said, “Blockstream is the biggest funder of Bitcoin Core and employs many of the developers. Who owns Blockstream? Well, one of the main shareholders is insurance giant AXA. CEO and Chairman of both the Bilderberg Group and AXA are the same person, Henri de Castries. Yes, essentially, the person most in control of bitcoin development is the Chairman of Bilderberg; the place that I have gone for the last three years to expose from the outside! And, even one time, briefly, from the inside. If the globalists wanted to destroy bitcoin, they would do exactly what they are doing with Blockstream.”

Again, [this has been pretty thoroughly refuted](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/84w9ue/the_reason_for_twitters_censorship_of_bch_related/dvtmc5m/), though if you replace the ""Blockstream"" with ""Bitcoin(dot)com"" in the last sentence, at least that single sentence would make sense. Unfortunately, the paragraph itself is a lost cause.

&gt;Others have stayed more conservative, saying if governments or other entities wanted to harm bitcoin, they would likely do it by causing major divisiveness within the community. They would slowly build a community of distrust, and cause a break in mutual understanding throughout the ecosystem. 

Bingo. Sounds like Bitcoin(dot)com and Roger Ver, in a nutshell. This article itself serves as an excellent example of what I mean.

&gt;This would allow for bitcoin to be made vulnerable and thus diverted from its course.

Hopefully not. So far, so good.

&gt;Whether it was diverted on purpose or by coincidence is still up for debate.

No, we know for sure that it *wasn't* diverted (yet), and that it's held strong against such attempts. What's up for debate is whether you're deliberately spreading misinformation, or actually believe the propaganda that you write.

&gt;The point is that cryptocurrencies can be harmed if they are not protected and nurtured. If the community lets their guard down for a moment, it’s possible to damage cryptocurrencies either by negligence or infiltration. Being mathematically stable and secure is not enough. The communities behind these protocols need to be strong, united, and open to communication. If not, they will leave glaring weaknesses in the network. They will allow the network to fall victim to nefarious actors.

All reasonable points here. I won't argue against this section.

&gt;The Salvation of Bitcoin

&gt;On the bright side, not all is lost.

Of course not, Bitcoin is doing better than ever.

&gt;Even though the first iteration of bitcoin was practically co-opted, it was born again in the form of bitcoin cash.

Ah, so now we see the author's true agenda: pump their pretender-Bitcoin altcoin. Really puts the rest of the article in perspective, doesn't it?

&gt;The community redeemed itself with upgrading the bitcoin protocol by implementing a hard fork and creating bitcoin cash.

It wasn't an upgrade (nor even a hard fork), it was an **airdrop**. Bitcoin itself continued along just fine.

&gt;Bitcoin Cash has kept the promise and vision of Satoshi Nakamoto alive.

I [have written](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7g50ki/roger_ver_craig_wright_hoaxtoshi_and_jihad_wu_get/dqgwsis/) comment [after](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7g4hn8/roger_ver_be_like/dqgtozt/) endless [comment](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7jzpir/after_roger_ver_openly_admitting_that_he_will/drbjsgd/) explaining [how](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/84yfia/lightning_network_visualizer_now_live_on_mainnet/dvu8t66/) ""Satoshi's [vision](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7y6rsp/this_is_not_a_healthy_ratio_of_clients/duebn6d/)"" aligns with [the path](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8gi0hv/bitcoin_has_activated_its_immune_system/dyc53jb/) that [Bitcoin](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7ti040/35_satb_010_fee_transactions_now_clearing_in_the/dtcvjtj/) is [taking](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7g4hn8/roger_ver_be_like/dqgmkfs/), and how [the term itself is ""in the eye of the beholder"" in a sense](https://np.reddit.com/r/BitcoinDiscussion/comments/7jlged/more_frequent_blocks_instead_of_a_max_block_size/dr8ztwb/)... but don't let that get in the way of your altcoin-pump-attempt.

&gt;It leverages on-chain scaling to grow the network and incentivize adoption.

It increases the blocksize limit to giant figures like 32MB when [most blocks aren't even able to find 100kB of transactions to include](https://cash.coin.dance/blocks), you mean? Wow, such adoption.

&gt;At this point, Bitcoin Cash has instantiated itself as the salvation of bitcoin.

At this point, BCH has instantiated itself as the most disingenuous of shitcoins. It's even sometimes used as [the flagship example of a shitcoin](https://coincall.io/shitcoins/) to explain what the term ""shitcoin"" even means.

&gt;It is the true bitcoin that intends on freeing humanity from the clutches of centralized bankers and governments.

Anyone who can read this sentence without either laughing or gagging hasn't been reading my response closely enough.

&gt;However, the community must remain vigilant. 

True.

&gt;What happened to Bitcoin Core should be a lesson to all.

You mean ""remained stable and upgraded seamlessly""? Or do you mean to refer to ""Bitcoin"", the token of the network that Bitcoin Core connects to and validates? In which case, ""repeatedly skyrocketed in value and proved haters wrong""?

&gt;If a community falls prey to predatory communication tactics and censorship campaigns, they may lose their cryptocurrency to an attack. They should maintain a healthy community and pay attention to the course of the technology. If they lose sight and vision, their dream will turn to ash. It will get steamrolled. It will be forgotten and placed in the dustbin of history. Everyone must always remember technology is not automatically impregnable. It needs a strong foundation of good people.

True.

For the driver problem, yes your point is good, I have to admit that Bitmain proprietary drivers are a pain. (I personally found some workaround in the hacking firmware scene). Again, competition can improve this. Time will tell.

For the ease of use of asic mining vs gpu, well it's conceivable for one crypto to develop a one-click miner. But running a proper gpu rig need some technical skills that are not needed In ASICS. And guess what! proprietary firmware coupled with specific hardware is the reason why this is possible. You can't have open hardware and software and ease of use and runtime stability at the same time, it's Microsoft vs Apple debate over and over.

"
&gt;They used this excuse to delete posts containing arguments for on-chain scaling. The leader behind this agenda was Theymos. He was known for moderating the r/bitcoin subreddit.

This has all been covered above. This would be better phrased as ""Based on the new rules, moderators of one particular subreddit removed posts in violation of these rules."" Doesn't sound so sinister when you remove loaded language like ""used this *excuse*"" and ""behind this *agenda*""; big subreddits need to be moderated, and alternatives are always available for those that want different rules.

&gt;John Blocke wrote an in-depth article on Medium about Theymos and this censorship campaign. 

He did, and it was even *more* disingenuous than the article I'm debunking right now, believe it or not!

&gt;He also cited a ton of evidence, including screenshots.

He did indeed include many screenshots in his article. Unfortunately for him, all the screenshots show is what theymos had already clearly outlined: rule-breaking posts would be removed by moderators, and users who were deliberately trying to break the rules, especially on a repeated basis, would be banned accordingly.

It has resulted in a *much* more positive, truthful, honest, and pro-Bitcoin environment when compared and contrasted against alternative subreddits like rbtc (where lies and misinformation reign supreme, and moderators regularly remove posts or ban users according to their own arbitrary preferences, rather than according to any set of defined rules). Recently, more and more users have been voicing appreciation for the job that /r/Bitcoin moderators are doing in terms of keeping the subreddit clean and focused.

&gt;He said: “Since the limit was introduced in 2010, there have been countless discussions on the necessity as well as the methods that would be used to increase this limit, and Bitcoin’s transaction processing capabilities with it.

That's true, and fortunately Segwit achieved consensus, so we proceeded forward with it.

&gt; Those attempts have repeatedly been blocked by a small group of developers, 

Totally false, for reasons that have been explained above.

&gt;and in recent years discussion of increasing the limit has been censored from some of Bitcoin’s largest discussion forums, all of which are moderated by the same individual, who posts using the handle Theymos. 

This has all been covered above; rules were put in place and then enforced. These rules had justification, and alternative platforms which have different rules have been available for as long as the rules have existed.

&gt;What is forbidden includes any discussion of code changes that propose increasing the limitation.”

Not quite. What is forbidden is ""submissions that are mostly about some other cryptocurrency"" (i.e. content about altcoins rather than Bitcoin) and ""Promotion of client software which attempts to alter the Bitcoin protocol without overwhelming consensus"". These rules make sense for a subreddit about **Bitcoin**, but it's perfectly fine for someone to prefer different rules (in which case, once again: other subreddits are always available to use).

&gt;A Hegemony of Developers and Bitcoin Crash of 2017

&gt;It should now be clear how bitcoin was compromised.

It should now be clear what sort of false narrative you're trying to present...

&gt;A group of developers and Segwit devotees gained the trust of the community in order to divert the path of bitcoin.

Bitcoin's path wasn't ""diverted"", and in fact, the opposite happened; those who *tried* to divert the path of Bitcoin [into becoming PayPal 2.0](https://soundcloud.com/heryptohow/roger-ver-cody-wilson-chris-odom-brian-deery-and-chris-david#t=21:30) have failed, and have had to create their own altcoins instead (which, unfortunately, they disingenuously pretend *are* Bitcoin when it is objectively clear that they are not).

&gt;These developers and their followers used censorship to obscure the truth about the scaling debate.

Repeating the same old lie... again, no Core developers (or significant contributors of any kind) help to moderate these discussion platforms; trying to give the impression that Bitcoin Core was policing discussions in any way is a lie. 

&gt;During this time frame, many of the original developers were expunged from the project. This includes Mike Hearn and Gavin Andreesen, 

*Again*, the Core development team is a diverse group of developers with blurry boundaries and a constantly evolving membership set. People who haven't contributed in years (like dooglus and Gavin Andresen) have commit access revoked according to [the principle of least privilege](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_privilege) and people who *never* regularly contributed to the actual consensus codebase (like Mike Hearn) never even have commit access granted, and simply make their contributions through pull requests. Note also that Gavin wasn't bothered by losing commit access (and never asked for it back), even [*defending* the decision to revoke his own access.](https://twitter.com/gavinandresen/status/728974522544750592)


&gt;who Satoshi himself appointed to keep bitcoin on track prior to leaving the project.

[This is a total lie.](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7rr3uq/psa_take_everything_you_read_on_bitcoincom_with_a/dszi8xn/)

&gt;The insurgent developers did not share Satoshi’s vision. 

Besides the fact that the phrase ""the insurgent developers"" is ridiculous to begin with (considering many of the Core contributors have been contributing since 2011 or earlier), this is *yet another* lie. A good rule of thumb is that if someone's entire argument is based on their subjective interpretation of an absentee creator's ""vision"", they don't have an actual case.

&gt;They did not believe that bitcoin could or should scale so that everyone can use it as cash.

This is totally false, and *yet another* strawman, and *yet another* instance of the author not understanding what the term ""digital cash"" means in applied cryptography.

&gt;They believed bitcoin should be a store of value or commodity.

[So did Satoshi.](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7g4hn8/roger_ver_be_like/dqgtozt/)

&gt;They even suggested that high fees and slow confirmation times are a good thing for bitcoin. 

This is a lie. No Core developers have tried to argue that ""slow confirmation times are a good thing for bitcoin"" and it's pretty clear why you didn't include a source with this bogus claim. High fees *are* good, because the system requires fees to sustain incentives as we evolve and transition from an inflation-based model, and fees only rise if the aggregate demand for transaction confirmation dramatically exceeds available supply (i.e. block space), which means that Bitcoin is succeeding in delivering real value to the world, by definition.

&gt;These developers were either economically ignorant or purposely maneuvering to destroy bitcoin.

Or, third option: you're pushing a false dichotomy.

&gt;Their ideas about harming bitcoin came to fruition.

And in less than a sentence, you've whittled your false dichotomy down to a single option. How incredibly disingenuous.

&gt;During the winter of 2017, bitcoin reached its highest price level, nearing the $20,000 mark.

Wow, sounds like these developers' idea of ""harming Bitcoin"" is pretty sweet!

&gt;However, during this time bitcoin fees also skyrocketed.

...and demonstrated that [demand for Bitcoin transactions is a lot less elastic than the naysayers had argued](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7ti040/35_satb_010_fee_transactions_now_clearing_in_the/dtcvjtj/).

"This part of the whitepaper applies to *both* BCH and BTC respectively, and describes the internal logic of the protocols to make sure it adds blocks to the *correct* chain instead of one of the shorter splits that occur. That is all it says, still nothing about how to split the IP directly in the event of a political split where two distinct chains remain.

It was exchanges and market cap sites that chose to based the naming decision on hashpower majority, and I understand that reasoning from their perspective. I admit this is perhaps a semantic difference, but it bothers me that so many think the whitepaper says anything about this situation, because it really doesn't. I doubt Satoshi even thought that far ahead. In the end regardless of what one thinks of it, what is done is done and there is no going back now.

Overall it is still a mess with a lot of passionate people in the mix. I do believe in any case it is time to move on from being petty about the naming stuff and just proving Bitcoin Cash's worth by proving it in the field as the superior roadmap over Blockstream's implementation. I understand completely why original Bitcoiner are still upset by what happened (as one of them myself), but continued pettiness and bickering really isn't getting us anywhere.

"The goal is to provide a stable store of value, the same reason you see so-called ""stablecoins"" being developed.  This is not an instrument to provide returns nor an ""investment"", it is a currency that holds its value and purchasing power over time and cannot be manipulated by a central authority (like the Federal Reserve and our fiat dollars) nor printed at whim into existence.  The use of real estate is due to the (mostly) stability of the asset class, but the platform has been designed to support any asset class or jurisdiction.

In Somaliland, for example, where the nation has gone nearly completely cashless, you don't see the adoption of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin or Ethereum but rather they are basing their mobile payments on the US Dollar.  This is because the US Dollar is seen as the most stable of currencies available and is widely recognized/accepted.  Cryptocurrencies carry a superior feature set and would be a natural fit for those types of scenarios, but they are not desirable instruments when you need to feed your family and can't have your money potentially halve in value over the course of a week or month.

It's important to note the asset tokens themselves are not being spent.  They are placed on deposit and during the deposit a valuation protocol and ruleset is executed to determine what the asset token is worth.  Based on those rulesets, the protocol will issue new currency units (turba) back to the asset owner which are equal in value to all other units in circulation.  This is a normalization process to turn the asset tokens into fungible currency that can be used to support transactions.

We see the ""wind-backed"" currencies (aka fluffcoins) like Bitcoin as superior to fiat but with critical flaws regarding the fact their supplies are fixed.  They fixed the supply to ensure no central authority can manipulate the money supply, but it is the immunity from manipulation (and not the fixed supply) that people are after.  The two are currently being conflated and are vastly different.  A fixed supply does provide immunity from manipulation of the monetary supply but also carries with it the drawback of compounded volatility, as you only have demand driving the price.

Using deposit of asset tokens to generate and issue currency units is a way to provide the same immunity but to allow the supply to expand and contract appropriately as prices swing too far above or below the value of the underlying asset pool.  If the currency is going up in price beyond normally reasonable swings, this incentivizes asset owners to deposit more tokens to generate new currency units as they can exact a premium for their asset.  This increases the supply while also adding selling pressure on the currency, putting downward pressure on the price.  In the reverse case if the currency price is dropping, this incentivizes the asset owners to buy back their asset tokens by acquiring and destroying the currency.  This begins contracting the supply and adding buying pressure to the currency, putting an upward price pressure on it.

The core benefit being stability.  Everyone can always see all the data behind all the asset tokens on deposit along with all the rules and valuation protocols.  The holders of any particular currency can relax or tighten rules as they see fit for their particular currencies, allowing them to accept or reject new asset classes and jurisdictions as they become available.

It's a people's currency run by the people for the people.  No central banks, no manipulation of the supply, stable store of value, or basically **Sound Money**.  Hayek &amp; Mises on the blockchain.

&gt;They were even willing to compromise whereas Core supporters were not.

This is totally false, and totally backwards.

Here's a great example to prove what I mean: [in August 2015, Adam Back proposed a hard fork to increase the blocksize limit to ""2MB now, then 4MB in 2 years and 8MB in 4years then re-asses. (Similar to BIP 102)""](https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/636410827969421312). Gavin Andresen, unwilling to even *consider* a compromise, responded by saying [""2MB is absurdly small""](https://twitter.com/gavinandresen/status/636569665284775937?s=20) and dismissing Adam's suggestion. When Adam [politely suggested a panel discussion](https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/636642220838285312?s=20) to see if a reasonable agreement could be achieved (noting that Twitter with its sound-bite limits isn't a good platform for in-depth technical discussions) and followed it up by explaining: [""my point was to propose a BIP intended as a reasonable compromise that would be balanced &amp; achieve consensus. @gavinandresen""](https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/636768837556244480?s=20) Gavin refused to acknowledge Adam, effectively sending the message that he wouldn't consider any sort of balanced compromise or polite attempts to reach agreements.

When the *Scaling Bitcoin* conference/workshop was scheduled for late 2015, both Gavin Andresen and Mike Hearn (the only two developers who were calling loudly for a blocksize increase at the time) were invited; the point of the event was to form a consensus in the technical community on how best to scale Bitcoin. *Both* Gavin and Mike refused to attend; neither was interested in any sort of compromise or on finding common ground with other contributors. 

During this conference, a presentation on Segwit was given by Pieter Wuille, and it was demonstrated that Segwit allows us to increase the blocksize limit *with a soft fork*, while also providing an opt-in solution to transaction malleability, paving the way for other scaling solutions like Lightning Network and Schnorr signature aggregation while also cleanly linearizing signature operations to sidestep other technical issues that would normally come bundled with a ""just increase the limit"" type change. Segwit achieved widespread support and consensus in both the technical and larger community; even Gavin admitted it was a positive step forward.

Since it was so popular and [beneficial in so many ways](https://bitcoincore.org/en/2016/01/26/segwit-benefits/), the technical community rallied around Segwit and decided to prioritize its development as a first step in scaling Bitcoin. In other words, even though the ""big blockers"" were unwilling to compromise, everyone else found an agreeable solution to raise the blocksize and page the way towards future capacity increases anyway.

&gt;The reason it looked like Core supporters were winning is because they had began censoring posts they disagreed with.

As I just explained, what actually happened is that reasonable engineers came up with a very agreeable solution, which found near-universal support (and *no* meaningful opposition until many, many months later, which seems to have resulted from the revelation that [Segwit neutralizes a detrimental mining exploit called ""covert ASICBoost""](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2017-April/013996.html) which was almost certainly being profitably exploited by Bitmain and its various subsidiaries and affiliates).

In almost every case, the alleged ""censorship"" that is cited in articles like this one (and statements like the one just quoted) is in reference to the /r/Bitcoin subreddit, where [rules were put in place](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3h9cq4/its_time_for_a_break_about_the_recent_mess/) to combat against repetitive and antagonistic [astroturfing and sockpuppetry](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/880ze8/this_sockpuppet_account_is_run_by_bitcoincom/) and [propaganda campaigns](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/a-closer-look-at-reddit-vote-manipulation-about-bitcoin-1458682699/) to promote consensus-breaking (i.e. ""Bitcoin attacking"") software, which could very reasonably be called ""malware"" from the perspective of a Bitcoin user. Long ago, when theymos (the administrator who later declared these very rules) [advised users not to run consensus-incompatible blocksize-increasing code](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1347.msg15126#msg15126), **Satoshi explicitly supported him in the matter**: [""**+1 theymos.  Don't use this patch, it'll make you incompatible with the network, to your own detriment.** We can phase in a change later **if we get closer to needing it**.](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1347.msg15139#msg15139) 

Satoshi understood how important consensus is in Bitcoin, and routinely agreed with theymos when they interacted; he apparently trusted his judgment enough to [basically appoint theymos as his successor](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/6s34gg/rbtc_spreading_misinformation_in_rbitcoinmarkets/dl9uovz/) (though unlike Gavin, who desperately went around trying to ""draw authority from Satoshi"", theymos refrained from mentioning this at every opportunity).

So theymos decided to implement and begin enforcement of a new rule in /r/Bitcoin, to disallow promotion of contentious consensus-violating software. He made a decision regarding how this particular forum was moderated, and offered his reasoning on the matter, responded calmly and civilly to the community's questions, then stood firm behind his decision. Many people disagreed with the decision at the time (though many of these have since changed their minds), but it's a moderation policy with legitimate justification that has been enforced relatively consistently in the years since its announcement. If this is ""censorship"", which I understand many argue it to be, then the [biased and in many cases arbitrary removals of threads that do not break *any* subreddit rules](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7dlyk4/censorship/duaqgxb/) that we've seen in ""big blocker subreddits"" like rbtc is **even worse censorship**.

Furthermore, to my knowledge, no Core developers (or significant contributors of any kind) help to moderate these discussion platforms; trying to give the impression that Bitcoin Core was policing discussions in any way is essentially lying. 

&gt;As soon as people created a post about on-chain scaling, moderators deleted those posts.

See above. Many posts *have* been deleted on /r/Bitcoin according to the policies and rules given by theymos. Many posts about on-chain scaling have also been allowed (in cases where the promotion of consensus-violating client software was not advocated), but because the vast majority of ""pro on-chain scaling"" posts in /r/Bitcoin are rule-violating, antagonistic, low-quality, and redundant, they are accordingly removed, just like someone trying to pump Viagra pills or some arbitrary altcoin would have their posts removed when reported or noticed by a diligent moderator.

&gt;They made claims that scaling on-chain wasn’t the goal of bitcoin, and those wanting to scale on-chain were essentially talking about another coin or “fork.”

Factually speaking, if you run consensus code that does not conform to the Bitcoin network's rules, you *are* running code for another coin. This is definitionally true.

&gt;Moderators and Core supporters got it into their head that scaling bitcoin on-chain was somehow antithetical to bitcoin.

Scaling Bitcoin *exclusively* on-chain is a silly proposition, given the reality of the trade-offs involved, and because Bitcoin's central thesis *does* involve decentralization (and brutishly increasing limits with abandon runs contrary to this tenet), it can reasonably be argued that such an approach *is* antithetical to what Bitcoin was designed to be.",1526165350

In data centers the power is there to serve a *goal*, i.e. crunching numbers, processing data, etc, so centers want to minimize power usage since power costs money. For mining, the whole goal is basically ""have more power than the others"", which basically leads to an arms race until the cost = revenue + small profits (at least in a free market).

This means no amount of optimizations will somehow reduce Bitcoin mining's power usage. Cheap power? Efficient ASIC? Miners will just grab more power if that's the case. If Bitcoin become successful and price goes up, the power usage will go up proportionally. If we invent nuclear fusion and therefore have virtually limitless power for cheap, mining will there be up there consuming most of those energy until the monetary cost exceeds the block rewards. I mean, sure, if the power comes from wind/solar/renewable it's better than e.g. coal, but in no world would a limitless appetite for power be a good thing.

I think the core issue is that unlike e.g. data center, more power doesn't equal more productivity in the society. In data centers the extra power can be used to simulate more advanced scientific calculations, store more pictures and videos, fuel machine learning algorithms, while in Bitcoin the outcome is fixed -- securing the network. It's cool we have a secure payment network but we don't really need to be consuming enormous amount of power to do so. That's why I think the long term solution is really to find some sort of PoS algorithm. I understand the usual argument against it, and am sympathetic to them, but I just don't see PoW being sustainable in the long run (as in 10+ years later) if Bitcoin intends to be successful.",1526164389

"
&gt;It is true there was a block size limit of 1mb, but this hard limit was only implemented to prevent network spam.

False, and a totally disprovable myth. Satoshi himself explicitly said that the minrelayfee (AKA the ""dust spam limit"") was [a **first try** at intentionally trying to prevent overly small micropayments like that](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=287.msg7524#msg7524) a few months *after* he put the blocksize limit in place.

The author simply doesn't know what they're talking about, and is repeating myths and lies without bothering to fact-check them.

&gt;The hard limit was meant to be increased as the network expanded.

Arguably true, but remember: **with Segwit, it was!**

&gt;The fear of centralization is also misguided. 

Not at all. If Bitcoin becomes centralized, it offers no value or added utility to the world beyond what we already have with PayPal. It would be an inefficient *clone* of PayPal, if it were centralized, in fact. Calling this fear ""misguided"" betrays a deep misunderstanding of what Bitcoin is and what makes it special.

&gt;Bitcoin can scale on-chain without much centralization, because technology grows at an exponential rate. 

This is a non sequitur; *it does not follow*. Imagine I tossed you a baseball at 10 MPH, and you caught it without a problem. Then I tossed you another baseball at 20 MPH, and you caught that one just fine, too. Then I tossed one at 40 MPH, and again, you catch it without issue. This is an exponentially increasing process... does that mean that you'll have no issue catching balls that fly at you at 80 MPH, 160 MPH, 320 MPH, 640 MPH, 1280 MPH? After all, you had no problems towards the beginning of the experiment, so shouldn't that mean that the exponential rate is nothing to worry about?

*Obviously* not. It matters where in the exponential process we are. It matters what the specific limits and thresholds of tolerability relevant to our experiment are. We can't just assume ""oh because things grow exponentially and they haven't broken down quite yet, we'll be fine"" and it's idiotic to even suggest this as if it's serious reasoning.

&gt;This is expressed in both Moore’s Law and The Law of Accelerating Returns as demonstrated by Ray Kurzweil. 

After reading the preceding paragraphs, you might be laughing at how stupid this is. That's a normal reaction.

Also, anyone who is still quoting Moore's Law rather than Nielsen's Law (the more restrictive, though still exponential, growth rate that models Internet bandwidth) in the context of Bitcoin scaling is either woefully uninformed or deliberately trying to mislead you.

&gt;In this sense, technology would keep pace with bitcoin growth to curb the possibility of increasing centralization.

According to the same argument, you can catch a baseball rocketed at you at 1280 MPH without any problems. Have fun with that!

&gt;Censorship Campaign

&gt;From the vantage point of an outsider, it would have certainly looked like the Core supporters were winning the debate and gaining more traction.

From the vantage point of an intelligent and well-informed insider, it would have looked the same way.

&gt;All across popular forums where the bitcoin commentary raged, there seemed to be no defense of on-chain scaling.

That's *totally* false. If you said ""there seemed to be no *intelligent* defense of *exclusive focus on* on-chain scaling *that properly took into account the counterarguments of the opposition*"", this would be true. But what was actually written in this article is flatly untrue.

&gt;In fact, the forums would have looked like an echo chamber to most people.

Only certain forums (like rbtc and rBitcoinXT). Plenty of debate (arguably far *too* much) raged elsewhere.

&gt;However, in reality, Core supporters did not have consensus. 

In a sense, that's true. There was no unanimous agreement or support for *any* faction; that's why a hard fork was essentially off the table. A contentious hard fork is something we want to avoid at all costs, after all.

&gt;There were a lot of people singing the praises of Satoshi by pleading for an on-chain scaling solution. 

This is such a disingenuous sentence it's hard not to cringe when reading it. ""Singing the praises of Satoshi""? Satoshi would not have advocated *pleading* for anything; if you want to see something implemented, *implement it!* You don't need permission to build whatever you want to build, but don't mistake that as ""permission to merge your code wherever you want to"" or ""liberty to force others to go along with you"". By begging actual engineers to make updates that you like, but that they don't agree with, you're not ""singing the praises of Satoshi"", you're whining and being annoying and distracting the people who are working hard on making actual improvements to the code.

&gt;They wanted to expand the blocksize to meet market demand.

"There is a lot of ignorance in this thread as well as the article, I find it interesting because a few months ago I saw articles here about being against ASICs and lots of people agreed. Either we have noobs or incredibly thick headed people or people are reading the article and are blindly agreeing with it instead of being a skeptic.

First off, everything in crypto is about the now and future factor. When you plan to implement something you look at what the present is and what the future may hold. At present there is a monopoly on ASIC manufacturing, with GPUs we have two companies that are trying to win over the consumer. Do you really think if Satoshi was inventing Bitcoin at a time where ASICs exist as they do today he would favor ASICs in the hopes more manufacturers get involved rather than GPUs that already have competition, cheaper than ASICs, and have decently performing open source drivers?
For one, ASICs are not cheap yet, and the ASICs you are buying now have been used and do not offer you a competitive performance per dollar as the manufacturers have a much more powerful/efficient ASIC only to themselves, you're basically buying used and outdated hardware. The hardware is also completely proprietary, it could be phoning home or have the capability to destruct itself/software at any moment and you as the buyer/user are stuck because there is no open source alternative. On the other hand for GPUs we have open source drivers available, so if the AMD or Nvidia guys decide to be evil for some reason and try to implement ways of the cards not performing well under certain instructions or if it detects a program running then you can still install open source drivers that are free of that, you could have an open source implementation of the ASIC but its much harder to get started and why spend the time when we have GPUs already.

The second argument is also incredibly idiotic. There is nothing stopping an easy to use, nice UI/UX GPU miner, Vertcoin one click miner is one of them...and really...it just has nothing to do with the ASIC vs GPU debate (if there even is a debate..).


The third point again has me at a loss. In what world would you call GPU mining less decentralized. I can buy a GPU for $300, or $500 and make maybe $30 a month and they don't come with all of the issues I listed previously....and a GPU can actually be used for more things than mining, unlike an ASIC. Not only that, I can walk to several stores and purchase a GPU, there are tons of companies making their own iteration of nvidia/and based GPUs such as MSI, xfce, evga, power color, etc. Once again, if my barrier to entry is in the thousands vs hundreds....the one in the hundreds is going to be more decentralized. Then we get into what I already spoke about, who is producing the ASIC and what power do they have on it remotely through software.


Can ASICs become cheaper? Sure. Can more companies produce more ASICs? Absolutely. Though that is not the present, that is the future, so I go back to my statement about what Satoshi in the first paragraphs. I would have no problem with this article if the author simply said how all of these things could happen in the future because it is certainly possible but it not true and we are not there yet.",1526161087
At these prices bitcoin is a massively high risk investment.. ,1526161049
"
&gt;The Core spokespeople said bitcoin can never reach the throughput transaction level that the VISA and MasterCard networks achieve by scaling on-chain.

Not quite. It can never reach such throughput levels by scaling *naively* on-chain, *without also rendering it prohibitively expensive to run a fully-validating node for most people*. The distinction here is critical, and the author's representation is an obvious strawman argument.

&gt;In order for bitcoin to reach this level of growth, second layer solutions would need to be deployed. 

Again, not quite. In order for Bitcoin to reach this level of growth *in the near- to medium-term future*, **without sacrificing the potential for most participants to be able to self-validate if they want to**, deploying second-layer solutions represents *the best known proposal to date* for achieving this.

Again, an important distinction. The author's version of the argument (i.e. the strawman) is not a very good argument. The real version is much more nuanced and valid.

&gt;This would occur by the addition of a protocol referred to as Segwit. It would solve the transaction malleability problem, and allow for the clean addition of second layer protocols, they said.

This is true.

&gt;Core supporters vehemently argued against any and all block size increases.

**Totally false.** See above (the numbered list, points 1-4). This is an outright lie.

&gt;They said it is not a solution that allows for exponential growth.

Well, factually speaking, blocksize limit increases alone offer at most linear growth, proportional to the increase in question. That's not really arguable.

&gt;It would also cause more mining centralization in bitcoin, leading to the possibility of a 51% attack.

While it's true that limit increases come with additional centralization pressure (and one of the drawbacks to additional miner centralization is increased vulnerability to a 51% attack), this is *not* the only concern which has been expressed regarding the risks of blocksize limit increases, not by a long shot. Though the author doesn't explicitly claim that this is the entirety of the argument, it seems implied that this is all of it, which is false. To list a few others off the top of my head: miner cartels can impact the security model even without standard 51% attacks, the cost of node operation is an important figure to try to minimize, and probably most importantly of all: a precedent of  backwards-incompatible consensus-code manipulation is absolutely intolerable, because it represents the potential to undermine everything that makes Bitcoin valuable and interesting in the first place. Technically speaking, limits like the 21M coin cap can be replaced in the same backwards-incompatible manner; the only dependable rule-of-thumb to follow when a contentious change of this nature is proposed is ""default to the status quo, which is effectively the existing agreed-upon social and technical contract"".

Some (including, apparently, the author of this article) feel that they should be able to ram through any code change they like despite the existence of significant and meaningful disagreement; fortunately, they are a vastly-outnumbered minority and the extent of their influence is basically the number of rubes they can fool with articles like this one.

&gt;For anyone paying attention, these arguments would have sounded odd, because bitcoin was intended to scale on-chain.

First, your strawman arguments *do* sound odd, and second, Bitcoin was intended to scale *both* on-chain and off-chain; almost any large and complex system involves a layered/stacked architecture, and there is *no* sound reason to try to cram everything into the very bottom layer of the stack. There are real trade-offs to doing so, and ignoring them isn't a smart strategy.

Hal Finney, who [Satoshi respected greatly](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2188.msg29259#msg29259) (and who was the recipient of [the very first Bitcoin transaction](https://blockchain.info/block/00000000d1145790a8694403d4063f323d499e655c83426834d4ce2f8dd4a2ee), from Satoshi himself), [pointed out that Bitcoin would need multiple layers to scale effectively back in 2010](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2500.msg34211#msg34211). Satoshi himself [proposed Lightning-esque timelock contracts](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2013-April/002417.html) as the solution to allow Bitcoin to support ""high frequency trading"", which hardworking engineers have improved upon and extended with networking functionality.

The author is basically saying ""I wasn't paying attention, and didn't know the whole story, but it seems to me like everyone agreed with me!"" This deserves serious ridicule.

Unfortunately, the surplus is going to go to the shareholders if the court refuses to go from bankruptcy to civil rehabilitation. Nearly all of the surplus would then go to Mark Karpeles, the CEO, who publicly stated that the money belongs to the creditors and that he doesn't deserve or want it. Hopefully, this will help convince the court since their foremost concern when granting a request of civil rehabilitation is that people who are owed money according to Japanese law don't get shafted.

I agree that the way Japanese law works in this case seems highly unethical considering that the men who let the theft happen through carelessness would become extremely rich off of our money. In my opinion, this case is so important that it would warrant getting the Japanese parliament to change the law to allow cryptocurrencies to be distributed to their real owners without requiring a conversion to the national currency. It would make perfect sense.

So the chance that my 50 BTC have the same or better buying power at the end of the loan is good but the chance that the debtor can continue making payments worth more over time is lower which is bad.

So I don't need to price in the risk premium of inflation of bitcoin but I need to price in a greater risk premium of the debtor defaulting. I personally think that individual defaults are a lot harder to predict than long-term inflation so the rate would probably be at least as high as current mortgages in fiat, probably higher.

The psychology of the anti-Bitcoin community has most certainly done so. It should come as no surprise, when you look at articles like this one and take into account the money on the line.

&gt;The Scaling Debate

&gt;It all started with a debate on how to scale bitcoin. A fiery discussion on how to bring bitcoin to the masses erupted between 2014 and 2015.

To be more accurate, the questions of ""how can we best scale Bitcoin?"" and ""*can* Bitcoin even be scaled effectively, without totally sacrificing its decentralization in the process?"" have been asked and debated fiercely since the blockchain was first announced and described. Any competent engineer, upon learning Bitcoin's architecture, naturally responds with: ""But how can it scale?"" 

However, it's true that the debate was thrust more into the spotlight in 2014 (more on that in a moment), so the author's primary point here is correct.

&gt;The scaling debate took place primarily on Reddit and bitcointalk.org, because these sites are where the community has regularly convened to discuss matters within the ecosystem.

A lot of the most prominent discussions *did* take place on these platforms, but it's important to recognize that not *all* of them did. Mailing lists, IRC chatrooms, Slack channels, Medium posts, GitHub, and even *real life conferences* were host to important discussions and conversations on the subject. If you were casually paying attention to reddit and BitcoinTalk, and not following any of the other channels at the time, *you weren't getting the full picture*.



&gt;Shortly after the debates started, individuals appeared to rally to the side of the Core development team, as well as the Blockstream company, who promoted the notion that bitcoin cannot scale by increasing the block size.

This sentence is a massive simplification, and arguably even a total misrepresentation. The Core development team is a diverse group of developers with blurry boundaries and a constantly evolving membership set, and plenty of internal disagreement and healthy debate takes place among the various contributors all the time. **At no point did the Core development team promote the notion that Bitcoin cannot scale by increasing the blocksize**; this is a lie. 

1) Many Core developers have voiced support for blocksize limit increases.

2) Multiple contributors have worked on proposals that would implement such increases in various ways.

3) Even the individuals who are most staunchly opposed to simply-increase-the-limit type approaches have never tried to argue that ""Bitcoin cannot scale"" in this way (instead, the more common argument is that ""there are better approaches to scaling it that we should work on *before* focusing on a blocksize increase, and misprioritizing our approach could harm Bitcoin's crucial properties like decentralization"").

4) **Bitcoin Core designed, implemented, thoroughly tested, and deployed a blocksize limit increase with Segwit.** This managed to achieve consensus in the technical community where all other proposals failed to do so, took hundreds of hours of work and thousands of lines of code (most of which was testing-related), and came with a long list of future-friendly benefits that will help Bitcoin improve and scale moving forward.

It's impossible to truthfully argue that either the Core development team or that Blockstream as a company opposed blocksize limit increases, because *both* contributed to Segwit, which factually increased the limit. The limit used to be 1MB, but this was removed from Bitcoin's consensus code last year, and multiple blocks larger than 2MB have been mined successfully since Segwit was activated on mainnet.

Here I’ll answer since you don’t know. Miners mined Bitcoin before when it was worth nothing and next to nothing because of POW. They knew because of Satoshi and he white paper he solved double spending. This allowed for hr first time ecurrency among other things like proof of existence. So don’t tell me price is not driven by hashrate at all. I know things have changed and maybe I’m current time it’s reversed where price now drives hashrate but it always wasn’t like that. Also BCH is a good example of how this philosophy holds true today. Many miners have mined BCH even when price was down to $300. Why? Because they believe in it (what Satoshi invented) ,1526158502

"I think the most remarkable thing about this article is how much of it is actually *true*. Some statements are really on point... but the author unfortunately slipped a bunch of lies and misrepresentations in there, too. Such a shame.

Let's go through it line-by-line, to make sure fact and fiction are cleanly separated.

&gt;Cryptocurrency is a groundbreaking invention. It is truly wondrous and revolutionary. It allows people to take back economic freedom from centralized cartels and undermine oppressive third parties. But even though the technology has the capacity to return power to the people, it is not immune to attacks. 

All of this is true.

&gt;Bitcoin, the first cryptocurrency, was compromised in an attack.

This, however, is false.

&gt; It is true the technology that allows bitcoin to function—the blockchain—is antifragile and resilient, but it still has an Achilles tendon. There is at least one attack vector that can harm bitcoin. Matter of fact, when someone creates an allegedly unassailable technology, it practically invites people to launch attacks against it.

Very true, and excellently stated!

&gt;However, the weakness attackers exploited was not based in code or mathematics. Instead, the attackers targeted a more vulnerable aspect of the technology: the community.

Hear, hear! This *is* exactly the weakness that the attackers are targeting. Ironically enough, **this article is an excellent example of such an attack**.

&gt;The attackers infiltrated the community

True.

&gt; and compromised bitcoin to alter the cryptocurrency’s original purpose. 

False. Bitcoin has resisted the numerous attempts to compromise its original purpose. It's still peer-to-peer, trust-minimizing electronic cash. 

**Note**: ""electronic cash"" is a [term of art](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/term%20of%20art) in cryptography, which can be traced back to [Chaum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Chaum#Digital_cash). Bitcoin is a **peer-to-peer** implementation of e-cash; that is its ""original purpose"" and that is what it continues to represent to this day. Its distinguishing property is that it is fundamentally decentralized, which means that anyone is free to run a node themselves in order to participate in the network without going through trusted third parties or intermediaries. In other words, the fact that *you* can afford to run a fully-validating Bitcoin node is what makes Bitcoin special compared to all the other forms of digital cash that came before it. Recognizing this, the proper emphasis on the whitepaper's subtitle should therefore be: ""Bitcoin: A **Peer-to-Peer** Electronic Cash System"".

This is worth remembering as we continue through this article.

&gt;They changed bitcoin from a threatening, extremely efficient, peer-to-peer cash system, into a less frightening, slower and more cumbersome cryptocurrency.

No one has done any such thing. Bitcoin is still the same threatening peer-to-peer cash system (see the preceding paragraph for more info on what this means). It is still extremely efficient *relative to other decentralized consensus networks*, but it's also important to note that by the nature of the blockchain's architecture (and more generally, [how difficult reliable distributed consensus is to achieve in a world where network faults are a reality](http://the-paper-trail.org/blog/a-brief-tour-of-flp-impossibility/), *especially* in an open-access network context where the set of participants in the consensus process is not predefined), it is *not* ""extremely efficient"" relative to centralized solutions, and never has been.

Even if you don't want to take the time to learn about the FLP impossibility result or other related academia, you should be able to intuitively understand why this is the case: it's *fundamentally* easier and cheaper for **one entity** to decide something (i.e. to agree with itself) than it is for multiple entities to come to agreement on something. In Bitcoin/cryptocurrency, *money is on the line*, so the stakes are high, and everyone is looking after their own self-interest, which compounds the problem and makes it even harder for universal agreement (AKA ""consensus"") to be achieved. Satoshi came up with a brilliant solution to this, and it deserves to be celebrated as a glorious breakthrough, but coordination requires overhead, and this overhead/cost/inefficiency is completely sidestepped with a model that simply defers to central authority.

Bitcoin offers many (very attractive and awesome) benefits by being a decentralized model, but *at least in some respects*, there is an efficiency trade-off that it makes in order to do so. This has been the case since the beginning, and ignoring the realities and trade-offs is *not* how we make the most of Bitcoin and the value it brings to the world.

Bitcoin is not any slower than before; the average time between blocks has pretty much always been just under ten minutes; see [this chart](https://data.bitcoinity.org/bitcoin/block_time/all?f=m10&amp;t=l) for a clearer picture of this.

&gt; It is now called “Bitcoin Core” or “Segwit Coin,” rather than Satoshi Nakamoto’s amazing invention, “Bitcoin.”

The only people who try to call it these things are disingenuous trolls and Bitcoin haters. The actual Bitcoin community continues to call it by its actual name, and we continually object to the persistent and hostile efforts (often spearheaded by Bitcoin(dot)com, like with this very article) to rebrand it into silly monikers like ""Segwit Coin"". Of course, these Bitcoin haters are desperate to attack it at any cost, and without technical arguments or knowledge, name-games and deceptive propaganda is basically all they have.

"Bitcoin has a long way to go before it ever becomes a currency, so until then it will be a speculative investment. You also seem like quite the hypocrite since the only points you've made lean towards trying to discourage people from investing in BTC, yet you say you want to see it become a currency. It will never become a currency if people listen to you and take the stance you have taken. Bitcoin needs support and early adoption from financial institution and private individuals before it can ever stand a chance of becoming a currency. I certainly hope this day comes but until then I won't be telling people to ignore the financial gains that can be had investing in it wisely now.

The internet has been around since like the 70s and 80s... but it wasn't widely accepted until maybe the 90s and didn't explode until the 2000's. It's important that we have patience and stay focused. Bitcoin will skyrocket but it won't be overnight. Just slowly accumulate bitcoin and don't look at the price.

"You don't owe Bitmex money, they will just liquidate you if you run out of bitcoins to pay them back.

Say you put in a 'long' trade (longs are hoping price will go up, shorts that it will go down). If you buy 1 BTC in XBT (the derivative Bitmex uses for Bitcoin) and set the buy up with 100x leverage, you will get liquidated when price drops 1%. In theory even less because of the fee of leverage and slippage that might occur. So at around a price drop of 0.60% or something your BTC will be gone. On the other hand, if price happens to pump and you close your trade, you now have made 100 times the amount that 1 BTC would've made you. It would be as if you were trading with 100 BTC.


Shorting is the same but then you win when price goes down, and get liquidated if price spikes up too much.

Businesses produce a cash flow and have legitimate value.  Crypto assets do not have a cash flow and are purely speculative.  Their price is only what the next person is willing to pay for them.

They have easily had a larger impact on adoption than any other person, project or organization. Bitinstant helped a great deal which did receive funds from Ver.

""Stop thinking of bitcoin as a physical thing. Bitcoins are just numbers on a ledger. Think back to a time when banks used paper ledgers instead of computers. You gave someone $100 and they wrote down your name and a deposit of $100. You don't own $100 anymore. You own the ability to manipulate that ledger now. You can withdraw from the ledger if you like to get your dollars back. But you could also pay someone else who has an entry on that ledger. At that point you've completely disconnected from cash and you're just agreeing that the ledger is keeping track of some abstract count. You could all call it 100 keystones if you wanted. Now think about what happens if one day everyone involved with that ledger agrees that no more keystones can be added. There are a total of 1000 keystones across all accounts. Now when someone wants a keystone they have to find a willing seller. How much is a keystone worth? It depends on one predictable measure, which is how much people trust the accuracy of the ledger. And a less predictable measure which is, how many people want in on that ledger. So you hear about these keystones when there's a hard limit of 1000 and decide since paid $1 for them and you need to put your money somewhere safe you're willing to pay $1.00 + $.20 for that service. At some point people in the next town over hear about the keystones and have been looking for something safe and know that you and some others have been paying $1.20 for them and they decide that $1.20 + $.20 is worth the security as well. Keystones now have a value that is entirely independent of the cash they originally represented.""",1526155982

"Some of the talk on ""closed source"" here is ridiculous as if that is 100% going to have your funds taken!

There are distinct benefits of open source and as a programmer I would like to see them open source this in the future so it can be publicly disected.

But you have to consider a few more factors than the binary closed/open source one before dismissing what I think is head and shoulders the best wallet out there already and is about to get even better.

Are you using an exchange to send your coins? Closed source.
Using a mainstream OS on you phone/tablet/pc? Closed source.

On top, if there IS a bug in the code and funds are involved if its open source someone will find the exploit and unless they are the rare whitehat variety you could get something like the DAO. If the DAO had been closed source it wouldn't have happened.
So sometimes open source is a bad thing.


In the meantime they have had Ryan Lackey auditing and are a company with a 9 or 10 year history of delivering product that deals with other peoples money. Their reputation and livlihood is on the line if they were to trojan their device. Their current services would be in doubt and I imagine they would be hit with lawsuits.


I understand why Enjin are keeping it closed, they had their stuff stolen before and the competition is fierce, often lacking morals with regards to copying ideas and code.

As I said I hope they'll choose to open source in the future once their crypto company is as popular as their minecraft cms business and so are solidified in their position.

 Coinbase is also registered as a [Money Services Business](https://www.fincen.gov/msb-registrant-search) with FinCEN.

Coinbase is required to comply with many financial services and consumer protection laws, including:

* The Bank Secrecy Act, which requires Coinbase to verify customer identities, maintain records of currency transactions for up to 5 years, and report certain transactions.
* The USA Patriot Act, which requires Coinbase to designate a compliance officer to ensure compliance with all applicable laws, create procedures and controls to ensure compliance, conduct training, and periodically review the compliance program.

Meaning that there would be outstanding bitcoins that the law has nothing to do with. They are in fact owed to those from whom they were stolen, but if the Japanese legal system insists that damages should be paid in JPY it would then have to decide what will happen with the *rest* of the stolen goods.

So if they are to distribute the wealth back to the creditors already, then what's the point of the trustee? Just do it from the get go and only liquidate the tiny amount needed for paying the independent contractors (those not owed bitcoin).

You need ID to open most exchange accounts. Reason is obvious: KYC - fraud, laundering, terror, taxes, etc.

Using an exchange centralizes the transaction. You don’t “own” the currency unless/until you own the keys - which requires you to move it into your own custody (paper, hardware, etc). 

However, all this talk of “centralizing the currency” is FUD. It’s still a decentralized currency. Coinbase won’t become a “central bank” because it cannot control the monetary supply. It can’t print or destroy coins.

Decentralization doesn’t mean “anonymous”. It means what it says: DECENTRlLIZED.

I view this as a positive. The more mainstream crypto becomes, the better. It’s not controlled by central banks or governments.

The exchanges, however, are. Why? Because, at the end of the day, the exchanges are dealing in FIAT. Exchange crypto for local currency, and vice versa. Once fiat enters the mix, so do governments. They don’t want money used for nefarious purposes or tax evasion. 

If that’s what your into, then by all means, don’t use one of the mainstream exchanges. Trade coins anonymously on the web - use exchanges that are unregulated. Spoof your IP. Print paper wallets. Go through enormous lengths to anonymously transact. That actually pushes mainstream away.

And at the end of the day - you can do all that. But eventually you’re going to want to trade it in for fiat. But guess what will happen? Banks will stop accepting incoming wires from unknown, untrusted, or unregulated exchanges. Then what?

You’ll have to come back to a trusted, regulated, known exchange. And show your ID.

The exchange and conversion to fiat has nothing to do with the centralization of a currency. It has to do with AML and tax evasion related to the local fiat.

"The assumption that your investment will be profitable in 5 years says everything one needs to know about your inexperience with speculative investing.

1% is a generous allocation. Most seasoned investors would rather hit the craps table than gamble on crypto which is largely regarded as digital Monopoly money operating on the “greater fool theory.” The potential for manipulation is beyond obvious to anyone with even a casual understanding of how markets operate. Your “hours” of research pale in comparison to people, like this man, who spend their entire days doing research for decades on end. People who don’t go to sleep until foreign markets have been open for an hour and who arrive at work hours before our markets are open. People who have studied economics and finance in an academic setting, people who generate models with probability densities that attempt to connect disparate actions internationally to the performance of our own markets.

Just realize that you are a retail investor. Dumb money. Nobody. Even if you allocated every penny you own and took out every loan you could... you’re fodder for real investors who control hundreds of millions if not billions of dollars. Your lifetime savings are a drop in the bucket that could evaporate on a hot day and nobody would give two shits about it as you’re kicked into the gutter. You’re an ant under the magnifying glass of a sadistic kid in the peak of summer. You’re a first time poker player at a table full of sharks in Vegas.

"There is nowhere in the whitepaper that assigns naming rights based on ""most work"". 

On either BTC or BCH (and anything derived from either for the most part), ""most work"" is simply the mechanism of how the network decides what the *real* transaction record is so it knows which version of that history should be appended with the next block officially. The network assumes the lineage with the most blocks added must be the correct one.

None of this has anything to do with which is the *real* Bitcoin. Both BTC and BCH are equally real even if you disagree with the direction either of them took.

&gt; Neither will I because it's too early to understand such potential. These things take time.

&gt; I also won't sit here and try to win you over when you've clearly made up your mind that Bitcoin is a poor investment.

I never said that. None of my comments referred that. 

&gt; My early investment in Bitcoin has given me the freedom to live my life as I see fit. No mortgage payment, no school loans, no car note payment, no debt and I've already cashed out the amount I put into Bitcoin and am still holding enough to retire if I choose, in one of the largest cities on the West Coast. If you've achieved something similar I'm sure you'd be of similar opinion but your not.

You are too young to know that. Bitcoin may have given you good profits so that you could buy a car without taking a loan. **I understand that. I bough a house!** But I'm also not a US American, so student loans is a thing I simply don't know and is one of the reasons why your country has a big educational problem.

&gt; Your someone trolling the forum of something you don't believe with clearly no purpose other than to troll. I'm here because I've had success with bitcoin and want others to know my story and have similar success. Obviously the majority here are going to be in favor of Bitcoin. If you want to find people of like mind you are in the wrong place.

I'm not trolling. I'm here because I like to make difficult questions. I'm here because I like to ask the questions which create hot discussions, capable of putting everything in questions. The type of questions Bitcoin actually needs. I'm not going to be here babysitting. I'm simply not that kind of person. You don't like my questions and arguments? You can simply ignore me.

&gt; As for anyone else who may be reading this rant, Bitcoin has changed my life because I realized it's risk and reward and invested with caution. Only spend what you can afford to lose has become an old adage in this community but it's still the best advice anyone can give. 

No you didn't. You did the same thing like every early adopter did. You bough a big amount of coins at a very low price. I know I did the same when the coins value were under $5 dollars. 
I didn't bet a lot of money... I bet around 2% of my monthly paycheck... You don't need much time to carefully think about such investment... you just need to not go to a night-party for one month.

**The reason why early adopters were so successful in taking such amount of profit, is because to go from 1$ to $10K requires much less money to enter the market than when going from $10K to $1M. Totally different amounts of money. The difference is huge! **

Yes you made a fortune, but to repeat such profits, the adopters that enter the market will need to see the price value go from $10K to more than $1M, to see the same profits ration. 

But here's the thing, the more it goes up, the more incentive early investors will have to exit the market. Everyone wants to have their lambo, right? I know you did! You bough your car, right? I bought my house...

And to end my point of view, the fact that you bough your car, paid your student loans, just demonstrates that Bitcoin is still seen as a financial investment.... *I want Bitcoin to become a real Currency.*

"The ""average person/reasonable person"" is a concept in law which defines reasonable expectations. If someone was selling ""Bitcoin"" with a big Bitcoin sign, and they gave their customers BCH, they would almost certainly lose their ""But its what I call Bitcoin"" case in court, as the average person expects to be talking about BTC when talking Bitcoin.       

     
That said, definitions are fluid and set by those who use them, language evolves as people use different words and names. Like I said, your choosing to call BCH Bitcoin and not Bitcoin Cash is itself a part of that process, but at this present stage, it is objectively a minority definition, which is unlikely to hold up in court if tested.         

Technically a hoover is a brand of vacuum, but it is commonly understood to be interchangeable with 'vacuum'. The same could happen to Bitcoin if people like you insist on referring it as you do. That's fine, or good even, I don't really care. Personally as long as the ideals of a decentralised uncensorable money live on in a crypto somewhere, which people can obtain easily enough, then Satoshi has achieved at least a big part of what he set out to do and the world is better for it. His idea was so decentralised that it goes beyond Bitcoin, a coin named Bitcoin can fail and his idea still lives.

* An easily\-implementable use\-case of blockchain in general, for both private companies wanting to add another level of security to their data, and also more on topic for this sub, crypto exchanges. It provides traders and investors the ability to support another decentralised solution
* An improved UX/UI to current mainstream authenticators. I can personally only speak for Google Authenticator but I myself have a TON of different 2FA's active on there and finding the right one isn't the most pleasant experience \(its not terrible by any means but it still makes a difference\)

If helpful, here’s a blurb i use with the genpop and to troll incorrect, anti-bitcoin articles. Probably need to tailor it to your audience and reframe the anti-banking points. Or just give it to the bankers straight. Adapt or die.
  
**What does bitcoin do?** 
  
With bitcoin you can:

Transact Value:

* send money to anyone (peer-to-peer) anywhere in the world in minutes 
* send micro-payments 
* optimize transactions 
* eliminate middlemen 
* eliminate bank fees, delays and limits
* eliminate bank delays 
* minimize paperwork 
* save billions in less-efficient third-party fees 
* banks the unbanked in poor countries 
* use a more durable, portable and divisible form of currency

Store Value:  

* avoid debasing (Venezuela, Zimbabwe…). 
* control your money  
* lessen the FED and banks’ control over your money. 
* access and use your money 24/7. 
* make money


The combination of Cryptography and blockchains allow people to instantly store and transact value across time and space. It's both a store of value (like gold) and a medium of exchange (like money). It's liquid gold. This consequences of this are disruptive. For starters, we no longer have to roll Rai Stones to each other. 


Cryptocurrency is like email compared to snail-mail. Imagine if, to send this message to you all, I had to buy a piece of paper that was only issued by a government (or private banks like the FED), write this message on that paper, send it to a third party (who is only open 9-4 Monday through Friday), pay that third party to process it, then wait 5 business days for them to process it and send it to you. Or I can just send you an email. With money, we currently do the former. With cryptocurrency, we can do the latter. With cryptocurrency, I can send you a penny, or a million dollars, right now, from my phone in the Dominican Republic to yours in Holland.


Saying cryptocurrency is worthless is like saying email is worthless. Or digital photos are worthless and we should revert to photo labs. And that's not to mention cryptocurrency's value as a speculative asset and a new asset class, or it's value in combating predatory banks and oppressive governments. Or the separate value and power of blockchains themselves.

Then one day one is bitcoin and then the next day the other is. That’s stupid. I feel like the industry has already decided by use. Exchanges call it that, trading tools call it that. The *bulk* of users I would say call it that. It makes no sense to change the name from one to the other. They both have merit some more than others but changing the name at any point in the future just won’t happen. It’s been this way for too long that you’d need every exchange to get on board and agree to change it. What do u think that will do to new investors?

The fun still is: most of us are very capable of getting our hands on ownership well above such an average number. 
Bottom line think about the odds you think BTC will be some form of currency or store of value etc. in the future and what you are willing to put at stake to bet or profit from it.

Whatever, for me the most sane advice would be try to understand what it is by reading discussing it etc and than start thinking about what you want to put at stake iso just go for some number since someone else with an agenda you don't know gives some advice...

"&gt; You really don't see how a service that charges for circumventing transaction delays while the people who charges for the service are essentially saying the transaction delays are a good thing because they cause high fees looks bad?

Have you missed everything I've written so far? Liquid is to make transfers secure and instant (couple minutes). You know what confirmation of blocks are right? Currently, whenever you send bitcoin between exchanges, the exchange waits for 6 confirmations before they release your funds for trading. This is because of risk of double spends, *even* when there is 1 confirmation. It takes on average an hour to get these 6 confirmations. This is true for bitcoin. And its the exact same thing for bcash. Try it yourself. Send, for example bcash, from one exchange to another and see how long it takes before you can trade. Liquid is supposed to be more like XRP, a semi-trusted system, that allows exchanges to *safely* transfer large amounts fast.

Do you understand this? Do you understand the difference between waiting for 6 confirmations versus a couple of minutes?

&gt; How about it looks neutral?

Exactly. It does.

&gt; No that doesn't work because they can't be neutral in a situation where they make money.

Do you understand that liquid's use case has *nothing* to do with full blocks or fees? Do you understand its use is in circumventing the need to wait for 6 confirmations that most exchanges feel are needed for security reasons? You need 6 confirmations, no matter if your bitcoin or bcash.

&gt; What would you say it looks like?

If we have zero reason to drive the price up, what kind of news do you expect for the boat to turn around? Lightning network for BTC won't be out for years. 
As a matter of fact, Bitcoin actually tends to magically rise. Take a look at when we were close to 6k for the second time, and somebody made marketbuys to push BTC up 10% in a few hours. 
You should look up sentiment in the dictionary, I don't think ""zero sentiment"" exists, it's either positive or negative, and we currently experience both because of the vast amount of short term mindsets. 

Now what we need is real life adoption and innovation in the space to create positive sentiment for the entire market, so we begin a bullrun, perhaps Consensus is the answer, if not the next big thing is trading desks for BTC, more liquidity to the market. Your post is not very friendly to newcomers. I suggest you don't listen to this guy. ",1526147051
"This is a call to prayer for a decent crypto-fiat gateway, or at least a decent crypto Visa or Mastercard that can be used by virtually all the citizens of the world. Yeah, I know, some of you think crypto is the mark of the beast, but in reality, it's just currency s/he is using to coerce us into worshiping her/him. Some of you will scoff, and that's OK. But what's so hard about offering up a little prayer?

An example: I was having a problem submitting some documents for KYC on a project. I ended up submitting a doctored document. Not falsified, but doctored to simply reveal the truth about my address, etc. I was unable to provide what was need for reasons I won't go into. I didn't think I would pass KYC, obviously because of the doctored document. I went for a workout and at the end of it, I offered up the simple prayer, ""Dear Father in heaven, please work a miracle and wave a hand over the reviewer's face, or AI, or whatever and get me verified. In Jesus name, amen.""

Then I slowly made my way back home not thinking much wondering if it would be days until hearing about the fate of my KYC process. I opened my email when I got back to my apartment and was astounded to see, ""Congratulations Mr. Vogt, you've passed KYC for,"" (such-and-such ICO, platform, or whatever).

So come on! We've got Consensus coming up, might be a good time.

And you're an atheist? That's alright, I probably don't believe in the God that you don't believe in either. And just take a chance, start and end the way I did (I can explain later) pray silently because the enemy can't read your mind, although crypto is probably just as good for him as it is for Jesus, who proclaimed:

""The Spirit of the Lord is upon Me... He has sent Me to proclaim release to the captives... To set free those who are oppressed."" Luke 4:18.

Sure some of those released captives will be racing fleets of Lambos down the road to perdition. But hey, that choice belongs to them, not John Q Law. And also, hopefully it will be profitable for Joe Six Pack who works as a slave on an assembly line, somewhere in Santa Ana, CA. He'll be able to spend more time doing the things he's interested in. So please join me, I already have been praying about this for a while and will continue to do so until the goal is reached.",1526147051

That being said, if you want a sovereign money, i.e. a money that can't be seized, censored, inflated,... you have no other choice than to use a blockchain+PoW. The reason is, that the control of money is a very powerful thing to have. Every state on the planet wants that control.

So every solution to the sovereignty of money problem must not have a central point of attack. Like a firm, a leader, some central figure, because *that* is where states would put pressure on and then we're back at square one.

Only bitcoin qualifies in this regard, simply because it was the first and the control over the network was dispersed over the whole planet. It its nature, bitcoin thus resembles something like a natural material, like gold.

Everything that came after was created in order to give its creator an advantage over later stage adopters. It resembles something like golden Chuck E Cheese tokens. It looks somewhat similar, but couldn't be more different in its inherent characteristics. ",1526145158

That’s a little clearer. Thanks. But ultimately ur overlooking what BTC does for the market. While we all want alts to separate it’s very likely that once they do the market will look very different. Gauging market trends will be a lot more tough as u don’t have a single gauge(I.e. bitcoin) to tell which way the market is moving. Additionally bitcoin is the front runner and like it or not we need it to a degree for adoption as most ppl are still not aware of the many alts and their value. Keep in mind I hold no bitcoin and haven’t for a year or more but I still see it’s time in the market and adoption. ,1526143257

The attendees will include members of the US Congressional Blockchain Caucus (huge for THEKEY, as they will be presenting on the very things the CBC in interested in), the UN Parliament, plus all the big institutions you've been hearing so much good news from over the last few days. Add that to the fact that 3 major industry announcements will be made, including an announcement by Circle (Goldman exchange). This year will be huge.

See, the non-believers see that the internet is disorganized and hard to find relevant data on and they just grumble that it'll never be as good as a library. They see that usenet is cluttered and hard to read so they figure online communities will get more chaotic and unusable as they get bigger. Then they apply this mentality to every other capability that the futurists and dreamers say the internet will have.

What these non-believers don't realize is that the believers are out there building the solutions and building these capabilities into the internet. Information is hard to find? Search engines were invented and in the search engine wars Google came up with a brilliant way to organize the data.  More users leading to a cluttered mess of voices? Well new web forums with nice organization came up and then voting systems like Reddit came up next, turning the chaos of usenet into useful resources. Online shopping and ebooks are hard to use? Well, the believers didn't just give up, they built and built and improved their logistics, distribution, costs, etc. until Amazon is kicking retailers butts. And those paper book stores are almost gone.

Ok, better, but still limited.  If Bitcoin is a chain, then how can it also be a unit of measure? Or a protocol?  Chain ==/== protocol. 

As far as definitions go, ""A Peer to Peer Electronic Cash System"" does not have this limitation. It can incorporate Bitcoin the unit of measure, Bitcoin the protocol, Bitcoin the chain, etc. This definition also defines Bitcoin by its purpose, which is very important to me.

&gt;Call it what you want, the point if liquid is to offer much faster transfers. Do you understand how that is not possible with on-chain tx where most exchanges want 6 conf before they consider the transfer secured? Do you understand how fast transfers between exchanges can be very valuable for some people (because of volatility for instance)? Do you understand why exchanges would use liquid regardless of on-chain fees?

Indeed faster transfer is a big problem if the main chain is crippled.

Let me remind you that exchanging money is literally what bitcoin was made for.

Your joking right? BCH has far more adoption than any other crypto. The only ones still using BTC are holdovers from the old days that haven't moved on yet.

Ugandans with Rasberry Pi's don't need to run a node. There are hundreds of thousands of people in other nations that have the financial resources to do it for them. Even i can run a node on my laptop.

"Your submission has been flagged for removal because it pertains to an incompatible derivative of Bitcoin commonly referred to as Bcash (BCH/BCC), or ‘Bitcoin Cash’. Prior to August 1st 2017, Bcash did not exist *(see:* [*“Bitcoin Cash Veers Off at Block Height 478558”*](https://archive.is/fCbpa)*)*. A small segment of miners decided to create an incompatible set of consensus rules based on Bitcoin’s existing network, and at block heigh 478559, Bcash was born. This method of copying an existing blockchain with no consensus among the existing network is commonly referred to as an airdrop. The Bcash token has become problematic primarily due to deceptive marketing practices portraying Bcash as if it were Bitcoin. But since Bcash is an merely impostor of Bitcoin, it really doesn’t belong in the Bitcoin subreddit. Therefore the /r/Bitcoin mod team (and readers) kindly ask you to post in a Bcash-oriented subreddit instead. Despite its misleading name, the /r/btc subreddit prides itself on welcoming all Bcash-related material (while ironically being anti-Bitcoin at the same time). Other subreddits which welcome Bcash-related material include /r/bcash and /r/bitcoincash. If you require assistance in claiming the Bcash airdrop or others, we recommend posting this to the /r/BitcoinAirdrops subreddit for more info. Thank you.

When you're new, every single project sounds insanely promising and a ""sure thing"". Especially tokens with less than $1 value as they seem appealing to newcomers because they imagine it progressing to $18k like BTC did so obviously huge returns. At the same time, people will also slam a coin that could be promising or return value because they see it as a threat to their investments in a similar project. ""Do your own research"" is what everyone says but appreciate it is a lot to take on a newcomer even when conducting your own research.

"&gt; 30% additional savings is not marginal. Shit 5% wouldn't even be marginal. 30% is god damn gargantuan.

If using XRP was saving the banks 30%, this would be the #1 priority of banks.  They would be buying up XRP from everyone and the price of XRP would skyrocket and not be tied to Bitcoin.

Sadly, Ripple has bamboozled you.  XRP is just marketing.  It's not being used by the banks.  There is no adoption.  That's why it tanks with the rest of the market.  It actually dumps harder because Ripple own the vast majority of the supply and the whole reason for XRP is to make Ripple money.

Koreans investigated XRP dumping on them.  Check out their research:

"Your submission has been flagged for removal because it pertains to an incompatible derivative of Bitcoin commonly referred to as Bcash (BCH/BCC), or ‘Bitcoin Cash’. Prior to August 1st 2017, Bcash did not exist *(see:* [*“Bitcoin Cash Veers Off at Block Height 478558”*](https://archive.is/fCbpa)*)*. A small segment of miners decided to create an incompatible set of consensus rules based on Bitcoin’s existing network, and at block heigh 478559, Bcash was born. This method of copying an existing blockchain with no consensus among the existing network is commonly referred to as an airdrop. The Bcash token has become problematic primarily due to deceptive marketing practices portraying Bcash as if it were Bitcoin. But since Bcash is an merely impostor of Bitcoin, it really doesn’t belong in the Bitcoin subreddit. Therefore the /r/Bitcoin mod team (and readers) kindly ask you to post in a Bcash-oriented subreddit instead. Despite its misleading name, the /r/btc subreddit prides itself on welcoming all Bcash-related material (while ironically being anti-Bitcoin at the same time). Other subreddits which welcome Bcash-related material include /r/bcash and /r/bitcoincash. If you require assistance in claiming the Bcash airdrop or others, we recommend posting this to the /r/BitcoinAirdrops subreddit for more info. Thank you.

While the price keeps moving down betting guys start betting that it will keep moving down ( margin short). Rich guys will then move the price up, to make the betting guys lose their btc again.

I am neither a pro, nor a fan of saying that the price dropped because of reason x. I think it drops for several reason and this might only be one part of the small puzzle.

"&gt; Cashaddr is too long an unwieldy and the prefix makes it worst - ""bch:"" would have been a better compromise IMO.

I agree `bch:` prefix would have been heaps better. Maybe that can be for the 2.0 CashAddr specification. But a worse part of CashAddr is the confusion with legacy address formats. Sometimes the wallets (e.g. Bitcoin.com) even drop the `bitcoincash:` off the front in the pay/receive screen so you don't know what address type you're dealing with, but it is a critical identifier for the address and required. The other confusion is that Base58 was a much better format for manually typing in the characters. Now CashAddr flipped all that around and added back in confusing numbers/letters. It helps if you know the specifics of the format, that everything has to be lowercase but if the wallets don't autocorrect simple mistakes like 1 -&gt; l or O -&gt; 0 and they use a hard to distinguish font it's a disaster. /u/zowki does Bitcoin.com wallet autocorrect mistakes like this?

&gt; ""Can you send me 3000 cash"" sounds like something a five year old would say. Cash is ""money"" to 99% of the English-speaking world, not a unit of measure.

Here I agree again. However using CASH, or CSH (sounded out as ""cash"") would have been a very nice ticker for the coin. Definitely not BCH (sounded out as ""bitch"") which will hinder adoption I think. Maybe when Bitcoin Cash takes over real fiat cash we can switch it then.

When Bitcoin Core dies off I wouldn't mind dumping the 'coin' from the name to avoid being sucked into the depths with them. Also we could reduce to two syllables which is faster to say e.g. rebrand as Bitcash.

"A premine usually refers to a block of coins reserved in the genesis block that goes to the founders for their contributions or the continued funding of the coin.  This is different from a crowdsale or token sale, which is what most people refer to as an ICO (initial coin offering).  An ICO is typically launched as a token on another blockchain (ERC20 token on ETH, Omni on Bitcoin), but an ICO can also happen for a coin that intends to launch its own blockchain/main net.  An ICO may also have a premine. For example, Ethereum was an ICO that also contained a premine for the Ethereum foundation.  

Many of the projects in the top 100 had either an ICO, a premine, or both.  Some of them, however, did not. To me, the ones that did not and yet still managed to obtain developer and user support are the most 'organic' cryptocurrencies.

"&gt; What I do care though is a whole space being PUSHED by the MtGoxes or the Buffets of this world in a snap. With a rumor, with some early adoption dump etc. How hard is this for you to understand ?

The alt/fiat market will gradually increase with time as the demand for it grows naturally, you should be patient. There are already a lot of alt/fiat pairs that are just simply abandoned with 0 (or fake) volume. Additionally, currencies with significant fiat volume also reacted negatively to these news. You are resenting the nature of the market. I understand that you have a very simplistic idea about how it would be possible to decouple altcoins, and I also understand that theoretically you would rather have a much smaller price that is ""justified"" (instead of manipulated, by goxers and buffets - as you imagine). You should also be aware that market liquidity is super important for adoption. If currently that liquidity comes from bitcoin, it makes no sense to blame the market. 

About the short term market moving entities: right now it is mtgox, but there has aways been something to get the short term sentiment traders preoccupied with.

Traders are constantly watching for price differences between exchanges and many are set up for arbitrage, so if a price difference appears they will sell on the higher priced exchange and buy on the lower priced exchange until the difference becomes negligible. This keeps the price pretty similar across exchanges.

Traders may or may not know about OTC trades. A big reason for OTC trading is to enable whales to trade bitcoin without slippage, without causing a big shift in price. 

The actual price across exchanges (averaged by volumes) is the ""true price"" of bitcoin - it is a reflection of the consensus of the market at any given point in time.

I just wanted to clarify that everyone's going to come into investing with different definitions for various terms and it's important to clarify those.

And I'd disagree that investment allocation should be the same no matter the value. Gas costs the same if you make $25k or $250k; you're going to pay different percentages for different expenses, investments, etc. depending on your income and net worth. That's why people who make less tend to spend a higher percentage on housing.

"That's good, but it would be better if BTC were presented as Bitcoin Core. And leave Bitcoin for the unforked chain. Otherwise it can be said also that Bitcoin Core is scamming users too.

BTC supporters would protest about that, then why are they upset BCH supporters protest against things like this?

That's because BTC is wrongly entitled to keeping the Bitcoin name. The problem is who decides this. I would say even when hash rate is superior on BCH, BTCers will not accept this as consensus.

"Bitcoin had the segwit upgrade ready for a long time but the miners blocked it.  Segwit prevented covert asicboost so it's speculated that was one of the reasons the miners stalled it.  Another reason why the miners stalled segwit is that miners don't make money off 2nd layer transactions.  Coinbase and other actors refused to upgrade their software to accommodate the segwit blocksize increase.  

32mb blocks aren't going to be tested until people start actually using bcash. 

Mass adoption on chain breaks bitcoins properties of decentralization.  This is why 2nd layer solutions are being explored.  I used lightning a few times and it's 20x faster and cheaper than bcash.  The 2nd layer also opens up more complex smart contracts that are being developed. ",1526133292

"&gt; Non mining nodes are how users of bitcoin guarantee that the rules of bitcoin are being followed.

This is a myth that really needs to die.

Non mining nodes are by definition absolutely powerless when it comes to consensus rules. The only way you get to vote on consensus rules are correct is by mining atop the longest chain that your desired rules agree with - with hashpower. A non-mining node that disagrees with consensus rules will simply fork off onto a miner-less chain. This is by design because hash power cannot be faked. If non-mining nodes had any authority to dictate consensus rules, then literally anyone could dictate consensus rules to the network by spinning up tens of thousands of nodes - for an absolutely inconsequential amount money in the given context, when compared to what it would cost to pull off a 51% attack.

&gt; But are you seriously saying that coinbase, bitpay, kraken etc don't need to run their own node, and that them doing so adds no value to the network?

When did I say anything of the sort? Even if blocks were enormous and the chain grew by many hard drives every year, all kinds of entities such as the ones you mentioned would still have a business need for running full nodes. They would run full nodes even if doing so on hobbyist hardware and/or on a hobbyist budget was impossible. In fact, if Bitcoin (Cash) saw the kind of global usage that made blocks that big, there would be many more full nodes than there are today, because there would be many entities with a business need, and they would write the costs of running a node off as a business expense.

I *am* saying is that non-mining nodes don't contribute to the network directly. I am also saying that they are necessary to ensure decentralization. [I am also saying that it is ok - and even desirable - if state of the art hardware and a datacenter grade fat pipe for internets is a requirement for running a full node is required.](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=532.msg6306#msg6306).

Non-mining nodes will be paid for and/or operated by everyone who has a business need to do so. As long as there are nodes all over the world, in many different jurisdictions, the network is decentralized - and whether or not you can run a node on a raspberrypi is irrelevant.",1526132972

"If you are concerned about crypto and taxes, only one of two things can reasonably be true. Either:

1) A wash sale rule applies when either buying *or* selling, so you do not have to pay taxes when you spend and replace on the way up, but you also can't claim deductions when you spend and replace on the way down. Or

2) No wash sale rule applies, meaning you have to pay gains on the way up, *but you can also claim tax deductions when you spend and replace when the currency is down*.

If you ask 2 different accountants you will likely hear two different answers. I don't know which is true for certain in the US and chances are that new laws, regulations or court cases will clarify it at some point.

If it is the latter, then sure, you pay gains on the way up, but if you increased your purchasing power by 100% but taxes take it down to 70%, you still increased you purchasing power by 70% dumbass :) You could also take tax deductions by spending and replacing when down.

If the former is true, then it doesn't matter, because it's a wash sale, and no gain or loss applies.

A lot of websites tend to suggest it is the latter, but I am not s professional tax expert, so talk to one yourself and decide.",1526132850
"Would be better phrased as ' to prevent network flooding'. There are two separate meanings here, and it stems from yet another of Blockstreams deliberate equivocations.  Spam as used commonly, has a negative connotation with e-mail or unwanted solicitation. Bitcoin however is a economic system and not strictly a messaging medium. Transactions have a cost. These costs go to miners, who protect the system. Ergo any transaction paying a fee is helping secure the network and by definition not spam.
    
The issue with 'flooding': it's more like a DoS attack, so many ~~spam~~ flood transactions that the network begins to buckle. The original design foresaw this, and like many problems, Bitcoin uses economics as the solution. With significantly sized blocks and a (non worthless) coin price, this attack vector becomes prohibitively expensive. ",1526132649

"**SCO–Linux disputes**

The SCO–Linux disputes are a series of legal and public disputes between the software company SCO Group (SCO) and various Linux vendors and users. The SCO Group alleges that its license agreements with IBM means that source code that IBM wrote and donated to be incorporated into Linux was added in violation of SCO's contractual rights. Members of the Linux community disagree with SCO's claims; IBM, Novell and Red Hat have ongoing claims against SCO.

On August 10, 2007, a federal district court judge in SCO v. Novell ruled on summary judgment that Novell, not the SCO Group, is the rightful owner of the copyrights covering the Unix operating system.

"**Moore's law**

Moore's law is the observation that the number of transistors in a dense integrated circuit doubles about every two years. The observation is named after Gordon Moore, the co-founder of Fairchild Semiconductor and Intel, whose 1965 paper described a doubling every year in the number of components per integrated circuit, and projected this rate of growth would continue for at least another decade. In 1975, looking forward to the next decade, he revised the forecast to doubling every two years. The period is often quoted as 18 months because of Intel executive David House, who predicted that chip performance would double every 18 months (being a combination of the effect of more transistors and the transistors being faster).

Means nothing. The rally from $100 to $1000 was artificial and performed by two bots. The rally from 10K to 20K was performed by an insane FOMO. Bitcoin has yet to  surpass the 10K with a solid and sustained position. It went twice to 11K, not to return to 6K again. Investors see this as a highly volatile asset, knowing it can blow in the faces at any time. Swing trades however love this, but they are there to make money, not to support the project.

If you think the high value is what gives Bitcoin a good credibility, then you are naive. I would prefer a low-value for a long period of time, in order to create the incentive to use bitcoin as a currency, than to have a bitcoin with large deltas of high and lows.

Do you not believe technology will improve (Moore’s law) so people will be able to run full nodes on $500 machine or even a 8 year old laptop? 

Mass adoption can’t happen currently because Bitcoin can’t come up with a functional off-chain solution that works as well as an on-chain solution.

Not to sound aggressive, but it sounds like Bitcoin is making a problem to prevent a problem that doesn’t exist yet. I appreciate the proactive-ness, but I think we could either rely on Moore’s law (for the time being while adoption has a chance) or come up with a clever solution for solving the problem while increasing the block size for the time being (I know this is a hard fork that they are trying to prevent). 

I guess what I’m getting at is that I think Bitcoin should have increased block size a workaround to keep the Bitcoin network functional during its peak while continuing to work on offchain solutions. We’ll know in a few days the effect of changing the block size on-the-fly when BCH bumps up to 32mb. I’m betting, in a month, everything will be back to normal but what do I know. 

Of course, all this is based on the Roger Ver assumption that people stopped using bitcoin because transaction fees were so high, which I halfway believe. (I think it was trending, people thought it was an investment, it dropped, and people got out). I hate how is argument relies on this so much. He’s definitely not 100% right but I don’t think he’s wrong either. 

Tons of layers to this issue, with one change causing multiple changes. 

But back to the name Bitcoin, I still think what Bitcoin Cash is doing is closer to what is in the whitepaper. Should we base all our choices on the whitepaper is another topic, as it was written years ago without knowledge of today’s technology. It did however rely on Moore’s law which has held up pretty well but has slowed due to technology limitations and future advancements.

"This is actually a bit backwards.

Ironically, technical analysis works better in crypto than almost anywhere else, because in crypto there are so many traders all trading on the same technical analysis cues.

Even if it didn't work, that fact would *cause* it to work and become a kind of self-fulfilling prophesy.

In crypto, a huge and sometimes overwhelming volume of daily trading is done via technical analysis. Probably a greater proportion there than anywhere else. 

In oil for instance, a lot of the buying and selling is fine because *people actually use oil* and so supply and demand fundamentals and actual use matter more.

You must understand that fiat currency is not the same as crypto currency, or gold etc.  fiat currency is a promissory note from your Government, the Government agree to pay for all legal transactions the sum written upon the note.  Banks are recognized as being authorities who can  judge if a transaction is legal or illegal.

"Here's my position. You can say Bitcoin cash is closer to the original idea of Bitcoin if you like. You can say it is what Bitcoin was supposed to be. You can say that BTC has been hijacked by banks and CIA or BCH is the brainchild of selfish miners who don't care about the longterm viability of the coin, only short term profits. These are all opinions or theories to put forward, which is how debate progresses when done in earnest.   

     
 You can not say BCH=Bitcoin, as that is currently not literally true. It is Bitcoin Cash. That is it's name.     
Additionally, you may have misgivings with the way certain people present Bitcoin Cash. That does not make Bitcoin Cash a scam, it *may* mean that the people presenting BCH as Bitcoin are scamming though. It may just mean they are at ideological ends to you, and are making what they see as a stand or protest against what they perceive to be injustice. Respect their right to protest, do not stoop to smear attacks in a vicious attempt to silence them. This applies to both BCH or BTC supporters.

No. Just no. I even don't want to explain why this is such a ridiculous claim. You can't copy gold, you can fork Buttcoin.

Oh, and have I said that Buttcoin is even an unsecure Investment because there is counter-Party-risk right now (Mt.

"I thought this for the longest time.  The problem is nobody is willing to decouple from BTC.  The coins that do come up through the ranks to attempt a challenge usually fall the hardest when BTC falls. 
 
The other coins that actually make great headway in becoming accepted (such as XRP, XLM, XVG and TRX) are hated by the crypto community, despite having communities that do believe in the coins.  The recent XVG news is a case in point - here is a project that raised millions  from the community to fund a usecase they weren't allowed to tell the investors.  They made it accepted on a huge array of porn sites and the crypto community met this news with derision.  Why?  Yet at the same time they band around coins like REQ, VEN, LINK etc that are all suspect in their own right.  Look at REQ's usecase - it's stupid.  They want to be the PayPal of crypto???  WTF is this meant to mean?  Every crypto is the paypal of crypto.  NANO is the easiest coin to spend out of all of them, but even NANO is now being called a shitcoin.  

To all REQ investors - Crypto negates the need for PayPal - what part of borderless, free or near free anonymous exchange don't you understand?  REQ's usecase is moribund.

Rant over.  Get in on NANO and don't give up on XVG, TRX, XLM or even XRP - if anything displaces BTC it'll be one of those - at least they're actively trying to find solutions.

When oil producers continue to operate at a loss it’s often a long game: they have contracts and relationships and they know (hope?) that the price will rise in the future and they will eventually be net profitable. Then there’s dumping. We could easily see a situation where a mining pool mines at below cost until a competing pool loses so much money they leave the space.

"BTC1/2 is not less confusing.

First of all, you need to learn that Bitcoin is a system, which uses Blockchain tech and this system works in a certain why (its working principles are defined in the Bitcoin white paper) and the original Blockchain got the same name, and ticker BTC that is used in exchanges.

Long story short... BTC got hijacked by bankers, the original Bitcoin supporters forked off from centralisation in BTC and BCH was created... the name could not be the same as Bitcoin BTC for obvious reasons... to differentiate that these are now two separate blockchains... one that is limited in capacity (by the bankers) with 1MB blocks, and other is unhindered and working as Bitcoin system should.

The real Bitcoin refers to BCH being the closest to Bitcoin system by far, and working like Bitcoin should... and BTC no longer does (thanks to SegWit Altcoin fork and 1MB blocks, removed op_codes and centralisation in the code ""development"")",1526128400

"The thing is we are not talking about a business like amazon or paypal.  Anyone with a centralized network can up the hardware in the server room to move more data.  Bitcoin is meant to be a decentralized distributed consensus network.  

The debate comes down to everyone can't verify a network if you allow all the data exchanges to appear on chain.  Only centralized mining farms or services like coinbase would be able to afford to run a system like bcash.  If mass adoption happens the amount of bandwidth and hardware required to confirm the network centralizes all the nodes.  This is where you have fake satoshi craig saying fuck anyone who can't afford a $30,000 node and bitcoin being a childs project being able to sync a node with a raspberry pi.

The cash crowd will say oh non mining nodes don't contribute to the network, but they do in a not so obvious way.  They are able to check and make sure everyone is following the rules.  Allowing everyone even the small players to confirm the network's rules are being followed is the whole point of bitcoin.

If the large nodes made a decision to change the rules or censor transactions or whatever attack they want to do, it would be extremely hard to take the control back.  By making nodes expensive and everything going on chain we can't fork the network away from bad actors.  It would be too cost prohibitive, and I believe if bitcoin ever fell into that position it would be a failure.  This doesn't even address the bandwidth and latency issues large blocks create.

At some point, your losses will be too great, and you will be ""liquidated"", or the exchange will force you to market sell those bitcoins at a loss...a huge loss.

Ignoring any risk of being scammed:

You have 1 BTC that you've earned through shady activities.

You send this 1 BTC to a laundering service. They hold the BTC until they've received, say, 100 transactions within the .5-2 BTC range. At this point, they send the BTC (minus any fees they take) to accounts specified by the customers, with, say, .5 BTC transactions, each to a different wallet/address (I'm not sure if receiving it on separate addresses would work - if it doesn't, assume you'd use different wallets).

You would receive ~.5 BTC on two separate addresses, and anyone who requested to have 2 BTC laundered would receive .5 BTC on 4 separate wallets/addresses etc. 

Your bitcoin would now not be directly linked to whatever activity you earned it through (Or would it? I might've missed something...), even though it would still seem sketchy AF coming from a known ""money laundering"" service.

"Holy crap this came out longer than expected.

I’ve listened to Roger quite a bit in the past few days and am understanding where he’s coming from. Really attempting to have a discussion here. According to Roger that’s impossible and I’ll be censored.... but let’s try!

From what I understand, Roger believes BCH is more similar to the way bitcoin used to work and what was outlined in the whitepaper. Instead of using a layer 2 solution he instead believes an on-chain solution is achievable with block size increases. Since blocks weren’t full until recently, block sizes were increasing on their own, just less than 1mb. Since Bitcoin has capped the block size to 1mb it is not able to continue in the same trajectory that it once did. Instead of increasing the block size, developers are working on alternative solutions using layer 2 methods. 

It’s very hard to find an analogy that doesn’t come off as sounding extreme. The best I can do is make up a hypothetical situation where  amazon.com is being flaunted on the news to a new demographic, that demographic is very interested and start buying. Amazon is no longer able to fulfill 2 day shipping due to the flood of orders. Let’s say Amazon has a hypothetical patented shipping process called a2z. They refuse to hire more people in the warehouse, which is where their bottleneck is.

The reason they don’t want to hire more people is because they are afraid that as more and more people use their service, more people will need to be hired and it will have some type of consequence(I can’t think of a good analogy - and I do understand this is an important part of the issue. Not trying to look over this - will address on it later). 

So instead they start charging people more for 2 day shipping and making others wait. In addition, they promise it will only be temporary because they are working on robots to replace humans. In the meantime, the average consumer decides they don’t want to pay $50 more to ship their goods and they will either A) just go to Walmart down the street or B) use other possibly sub-par online retailers that offer free 2 day shipping. 

Now someone comes along and says “I am making a business that has everything Amazon has, but we are willing to hire more people to fulfill free 2 day shipping. We will use Amazon’s a2z process but just hire more people. We anticipate we’ll be able to do this for a while and if the robot solution works out then we can use that too.”

Amazon’s a2z worked for years until Amazon hit a bottleneck by making a rule to not hire more people - started developing robots that are not widely available for use and aren’t ready yet, in the meantime losing customer base because they aren’t able to offer 2 day shipping. Meanwhile, the other company hired more people and are able to fulfill 2 day shipping as it once existed with Amazon for years. 

So which is the a2z process? The new one that amazon uses because amazon made it, or the one that Amazon made and is being used the same way it was being used for years before amazon decided to not hire more workers.  

This is why Roger believes Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin. 

The reason this topic is not black and white is because the devil is in the details. Amazon wont hire more employees because it may have some future impact if they hire too many employees. The catch is, nobody wants to use their services because shipping rates are so high. So they either go back to what they are used to (easy) or go to an Amazon alternative (less likely but if the online shopping experience is interesting to the individual it may happen). Comically, Amazon will never replace local Walmart if they aren’t usable now, so the issue they are worrying about with too many employees will never happen. 

I think I’m pretty reasonable. I tried not to be too biased in this analogy and would love to see working layer 2 solutions provide cheaper transaction fees. At this time, however, I can at least see where the Bitcoin Cash team is coming from. Especially with the out that technologies that can be used on Bitcoin can (apparently) be used on Bitcoin Cash. 

Would like to hear your thoughts on the a2z analogy and anything else I’ve said. 

I’d like to keep the discussion pleasant if at all possible as I believe finger pointing and name calling diminishes the discussion. I apologize is advance if anything I said comes off as offensive, but would like to know what was if so. ",1526126505

I hate there is no safehaven when btc crashes, but on the flip side, decoupling would take the air out of a market where there are many new coins that can't stand on their own because they have no working project as of yet.   

Take Sirin for example (hold no bags).   How much would it take to actually fund Finney (blockchain mobile phone &amp; desktop).   How hard would it be to raise the equivalent VC funds and over what time frame?   Sure, it may turn out to exit scam or launch shitty tech, but they only have the opportunity because of being pegged to btc.  piedpipercoin is another example, we might never get that level of encryption if they couldn't get $0.07/coin.   Hell, we'd have to suffer through it being ad driven if VC funded and not coupled with btc.

This whole sector like a massive startup incubator fueled by massive speculation, sure lots of shitcoins are there (most probably) but that the market is way overvalued and totally hinged to btc means that startups that might have a future have some money to develop.

1) When storing important files (e.g., family pictures, documents, etc.), people want the safety of a reliable, proven option. The likes of Google and Amazon have already proven to customers that they can reliably store customer files (and do a whole bunch of other things) without screwing it up. Customers will pay a little extra for this peace of mind and will be hesitant to switch to an unproven alternative that might lose/corrupt their important files. Google and Amazon are also integrated into everything we use, so they have a convenience advantage.

2) Ironically, saying that files will be stored in a decentralized manner will sound like a less secure option to the lay person because they will think all their files are accessible by many unknown people. ""You mean my files will be stored on a bunch of random people's computers around the world?""

These issues can be overcome, but I think the way the projects market/sell their product will determine if people use it and which decentralized project will be most successful. It's still early and it will be interesting to see how they bring the products to mass markets.

"What's interesting to note in the article is who the main beneficiaries and proponents of a cashless society are:

&gt; it cannot have surprised anyone closely involved in the matter, that this would result in chaos and extreme hardship, especially for the majority of poor and rural Indians, who were flagged as the supposed beneficiaries of the badly misnamed “financial-inclusion”-drive. USAID and partners had analysed the situation extensively and found in the Beyond-Cash-report that 97% of transactions were done in cash and that only 55% of Indians had a bank account. They also found that even of these bank accounts, “only 29% have been used in the last three months“.

Furthermore

&gt; However, for Visa, Mastercard and the other payment service providers, who were not affected by these existential problems of the huddled masses, the assault on cash will most likely turn out a big success, “scaling up” digital payments in the “trial region”. After this chaos and with all the losses that they had to suffer, all business people who can afford it, are likely to make sure they can accept digital payments in the future. And consumers, who are restricted in the amount of cash they can get from banks now, will use opportunities to pay with cards, much to the benefit of Visa, Mastercard and the other members of the extended Better Than Cash Alliance.

Who are the members of the BTCA (Better Than Cash Alliance)?

Coca-Cola group: Visa, Mastercard, The Gates Foundation and eBay.

The biggest challenge for Bitcoin Cash will be making these rural communities know that an alternative and far superior solution is available to  them. Tools like Cointext can be a huge success in this particular domain.",1526121687

&gt; There is an initiative by central banks to eliminate fiat cash (coins and banknotes), and the reason is that they can use negative interest rates more effectively.

* Interviewer doesn't understand that removing money from the supply increases the value of all the other money that exits
* Interviewer believes reduction of confusion (BCH/BTC) is paramount, so BCH+proponents are hurting Bitcoin overall by arguing that BCH is more Bitcoin than BTC.

"Couple of points. Now, I know nothing about crypto.

Was going to chuck 10k at bitcoin when it was 300 a piece but got fed up trying to figure out how to actually do that in the 40 minutes that it popped into my head. So take that for what you will.

I do know presentations and public speaking though.

1. Know your audience.
These folks are not investing in it, they are not discussing the pros and cons of each coin.
They are bank tellers and loan officers who think crypto is used to buy kilos of cocaine and ak47's by 14 year olds in a basement. Or all the Mexican cartels to launder billions of dollars. A lot of these people wont understand how compound interest works. 

2. 15 minutes is not a lot of time.
Start small, give 2-3 minutes on the history and mystery of how it works. Make sure you include the story on the British ""miner"" who chucked his hard drive in the bin and has been searching for his lost millions in the local land fill. 

3. Relate it them. 
She got interested when you started discussing how the exchanges have started following KYC and AML regulations so follow on with that.

4. Have handouts.
Call back and ask how many people will be there. Produce a small maybe 2-4 page pdf handout and email it through to the manager and ask for X copies to be produced prior to the talk for you to hand out.

5. Your title
You make dam sure your full name, email and phone number is on that handout. Just above your title ""Digital Currency Consultant""

6. Never call it Crypto. Thats darknet stuff. Digital Currency is what they are afraid of.

That is how you get a job at a bank in 15 minutes.",1526120063

So far the blockstream business has been to offer basic bitcoin feature via paid sidechain.

&gt;Tell me, how is blockstream profiting from ""crippled"" on chain tx? Consultancy? Theyve got no monopoly on that, and could just as well consult for doing the same onchain if it was possible.

The more crippled is the main chain is the more need for sophisticated sidechain there is.

"&gt;without slippage in a few days. 

....lol

EDIT: So your rebuttal to ""lol"" got up-votes. Okay:-

I'm a professional trader and found your use of terminology funny because its completely wrong. Slippage occurs when you sell at spot price. 

Slippage is the market spread required to fill the order in its entirety. ""Slippage over a few days"" is just retarded. You're describing a limit order and using terminology that applies to market sells. 

Also the overall message in this post is totally retarded. There is huge slippage in Bitcoin and there is slippage even in the largest Forex market pair EURUSD for even small orders.

If you market sell/buy 100 lots in EURUSD on a GOOD broker during PEAK times like the London open in a PROFESSIONAL account you will still often enter the market a half pip away from where you executed the order which will set off your trade in minus 100's USD right off the bat.

For your information 100 lots is very accessible for a professional *retail* trader. Institutions can use hundreds or thousands, even tens of thousands. This is why they *scale* into positions or buy into positions where people will be selling, or vice versa.

Or the ID is issued from a country that has so much corruption that the western financial system does not accept their credentials. For these people cash is king, its their only means of trade.

Owning cryptocurrency is much safer than hoarding cash under the bed. a) It does not depreciate because of inflation b) its more difficult to steal than cash in a jar. There is _no_ way that cryptocurrency can enter in circulation with these 5 billion people without face to face cash transactions. Which is why pages like localbitcoin etc are very popular. As Bitcoin / cryptocurrency rise in demand, so will cash&lt;-&gt;crypto rise. It kind of goes hand in hand. So my logic is not dumb.

"**What is WAX?**

WAX is a platform and a token that allows anyone to create a marketplace for digital assets.

From the founders of OPSkins, the #1 virtual item marketplace in the world, WAX is designed to significantly expand the $50 billion market for buying and selling video game virtual items.

The WAX Platform will allow many other kinds of digital assets to be traded, so virtually any asset that can be tokenized will benefit from WAX.

OPSkins already handles millions of digital items, and WAX will tokenize them for trading anywhere.

**Why do I need the WAX Platform?**

As big as the item trading industry already is, consumers must still contend with multiple challenges when buying or selling a digital object. Buyers and sellers are often in different countries and work with different currency types. Currency conversion costs, payment processing fees and credit card chargebacks can eat up the sales proceeds. This is particularly an issue for the small dollar sized transactions that make up most of the items traded. And because these items are digital, fraud is a bigger than with physical items where people must ship something to a physical address.

For example, someone in Brazil who wants to buy a digital item from a seller in Germany would have a difficult time doing so without paying high currency conversion and cross border payment processing fees. Counter-party risks, inherent in any situation where transactions are between strangers, are present for both sides.

WAX eliminates these problems through the use of cryptocurrency, smart contracts and blockchain based settlement.

The WAX Platform provides all these digital merchandising capabilities for free to the tens of thousands of video gaming community and content sites that want to take part in the $50 billion virtual item industry. Think about how profound that is. Any website owner connected to the video gaming or esports industry will be able to use the WAX platform to offer OPSkins like virtual item marketplace features with nearly zero effort.

Digital entrepreneurs can provide their audiences with the same robust ecommerce capabilities as OPSkins to allow their customers to buy and sell virtual items.

Every time an item is purchased, the WAX Platform automatically completes the settlement process with all the parties involved instantly (buyer, seller, settlement agent, affiliates, listing sites, etc). WAX ushers in a new generation of digital item “powersellers” such as those found on eBay, Amazon, or Alibaba.

**Why do I need a WAX Token? Why can’t I use Bitcoin/Ethereum/or other tokens?**

Given our unparalleled experience in operating digital item marketplaces, combined with our deep domain expertise in blockchain based technologies, we understand that a custom platform and token designed for the unique circumstances of virtual item trading is the optimal solution for the needs of this 400 million strong community.

The top reasons include security, transparency and the multitude of different settlement capabilities required since each game publisher creates items that are essentially different asset classes.

We’ve leveraged the experience we’ve gained building other blockchain based businesses as well as running the #1 virtual item marketplace in the world (www.opskins.com) and developed a token that is ideally suited for how digital goods are traded. The WAX utility token eliminates the need for trust between buyer and seller and can be standardized for the common transaction types occurring in this $50 billion industry.

**What can I do with a WAX token?**

As an individual consumer, you can safely buy digital items from anyone anywhere in the world. Marketplace owners can use the WAX platform to become an item listing site to capture new revenue opportunities from your existing customers as they buy and sell items through your site.

WAX makes it possible to discover all the virtual items available for sale across the world and securely trade those items with other enthusiasts.

**Who will use WAX?**

There are more than 400 million video gamers who trade virtual items today, out of about 2 billion gamers overall worldwide. WAX provides complete transparency of all available item inventory in real time and exposes that information to the global pool of buyers and sellers.

Eventually our blockchain based system could be used by video game publishers to provide more comprehensive item trading capabilities within their games.

**Who is behind the WAX Platform?**

The founders have operated highly successful digital businesses in item trading, cryptocurrency, venture capital and video game publishing. WAX CEO, William Quigley, is a world renowned venture capitalist who was the first institutional investor in PayPal, co-founded the widely used Tether coin used by leading crypto exchanges across the world and is the CEO of OPSkins.

WAX COO, Jonathan Yantis, invented the concept of real money virtual item trading and created the first and biggest virtual item marketplace, IGE.

WAX Lead Designer, John Brechisci Jr., is founder and CTO of OPSkins, and brings a deep understanding of the skin trading industry to WAX.

WAX President, Malcolm CasSelle, is CIO at OPSkins and formerly President and CTO at tronc / Tribune Publishing. He has built four digital media technology companies from startup to successful exit, in IPO or trade sales to public companies.

**How will WAX benefit other industries?**

We have a lot of ideas of how WAX could benefit other industries. Imagine if someone could send an actual physical item (i.e. a rare coin) to a vault, receive a blockchain based token in its place, and then trade that digital marker instead of the physical item? This would enable digital to physical item trading, letting the owner of a video game skin trade that item for a quantity of actual gold instead of fiat currency. The possibilities for multi-party digital to physical item trading are boundless.

By having a secure blockchain based open architecture, we hope to provide a tool for entrepreneurs everywhere to create new businesses opportunities around safe and secure item trading. That is what WAX creates.",1526113302

Show that crypto is digital cash.  Fiat cash is legal, and we all use it every day, it is completely fungible (look that up if you don't know what it means) and fully anonymous.  Crypto is similar in that it is P2P like cash, but there is a full audit trail in the block chain that actually makes it less likely for criminal use and feasible to track tainted funds (except privacy coins).

"Point out that Bitcoin was created after the storm of the banking meltdown in 2008

That it wasn't created by thieves and addicts, show a screen of BTC's whitepaper where its noble motivations are penned down.

Also mention Satoshi as a mythical figure for wow effect (and his 'lost' millions of BTC (or billions ?))

If you want them to really click with crypto you can't avoid explaining the fundamentals of blockchain; a public ledger, decentralized, trustless. Go briefly into each of these concepts and their advantages over the old timey structures. Also briefly explain mining; breaking the encryption algorithm by multiple miners to come to a consensus on what transactions the next block contains and then publish that block with the incentive of a block reward. I would not go too in depth on PoW vs PoS stake for now.

Show a printscreen of CMC, point to fact that there are 1000 shitcoins, but also 200 serious projects that will disrupt their respective target areas.

Services industries via smart contracts (Ethereum)
Supply chain management (Vechain ?)
Transparent non-censored internet (substratum)
Elections
Internet of Things (Iota, e.g. automatic charging of electric cars)
Cross border banking (Ripple, Stellar)
Payments (BTC, Verge). 

These are just some of my head I'm sure there are way more, just browse CMC.

If they ask why so many shitcoins, you could explain forking. Which could be considered a disadvantage of crypto, but actually isn't because it totally fits its decentralized nature. A coin is owned by noone and anyone can use the open source code for their own implementation.

Explain the verification process and KYC requirements. Also point to fact that crypto's KYC is generally way more efficient than those of regular banks, at least compared to where I live (I work in KYC). Crypto is automated via a passport pic with your mobile, while real banks require you to walk to a real offfice where a real person has to make a photo copy of your passport and then scan it (sigh...)

Show the growth of crypto over the past years. Be frank about the huge Dec-Jan spike and tell them that it got it a lot of exposure and nervous (old time, retarded) regulators, but that crypto is in development for way longer and than that and is continuing to be everyday with adoption only increasing, never decreasing.

Mention that 100's of banks partnered with Ripple
Stellar partnered with IBM
Iota partnered with Bosch
Verge partnered with Mindgeek (nr.1 porn online porn network, or maybe leave this one out, but still porn has historically been at the forefront and 'made' many technical developments like VHS or Bluray)
- 'Big four' consultancy firms (PWC, KPMG, Deloitte) are actively marketing their blockchain efforts not to be left behind
- CME offers futures
- NYSE is considering crypto
- Goldman started a crypto trading desk.

Mention that there are 1,5 people in the world without access to a bank account and that crypto will grant these 'unbanked' the right to financial participation and more fairly distribute wealth.

Again mention that crypto is not only for criminals, that this couldn't be farther from the truth. Actually the public ledger makes tracing bad money way easier for autorities compared to cash money. For governments it is actually a win-win situation, although they don't realize this themselves yet.

With trustless, faster and fairer crypto is a technical revolution, similar to telephone or internet. 

Humankind's primary evolution mechanism is intelligence. For better or worse people have always gravitated towards the best tech, be it iron axes, trains, radio's, fridges, computers or Google. This got them to the nr.1 spot in the foodchain.
Despite all uncertainties currently still felt by older generations, blockchain is simply the best tech.
