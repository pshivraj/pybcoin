"I partially agree about the hype, but only because most of crypto assets are not serving any real purpose. They exist because some hope to buy and sell while they can. There isn't much time left for most of them. It's a harsh statement but most of them are worthless when it comes to solving real world problems. Their existence is predicated on speculation.
XRP on the other hand has a very different approach and strategy. Speculative gains will come but they are not what's going to propel it to the top, usage and eventual recognition.

"&gt;If either of these mail providers loses your email (and it wouldnt be the first time), you're screwed.

Why would I be screwed? The 2 email services are meant to serve as a back-up. As I said, I already have the word seed memorized.

&gt;gaining access to these email accounts is probably a very similar problem to solve for a hacker, like installing a keylogger on your PC + obtaining your phone or your 2FA backup codes or installing some malware on your phone, ..

It what universe is any of that going on where it would be safe for me to use Bitcoin at all? And for that matter, wouldn't the hacker have to care first? Why am I being targeted in this scenario? I'm aware that it isn't impossible for me to be compromised... I'm saying it's damn unlikely, and the potential for the 12-word seed written on a piece of paper being found, lost, or stolen is greater.

&gt;Also, at least with gmail's 2FA, you dont need the 2FA unless you are logging in from a different machine. If someone hacks your PC, the 2FA isnt needed.

This isn't true if you log out. Every log-in requires 2-factor.

&gt;that I know and my family knows or can find out

Okay, does that mean that it's your family's Bitcoin, or yours? I'm not interested in my wife deciding one day that my Bitcoin will go very nicely with her new life in the Cayman Islands. Or that my daughter decides to help herself to some Bitcoin because she thinks she deserves it.

&gt;A puzzle thats impossible to solve for a random hacker, and even someone in my family/friend will have to do some social engineering to obtain the answers, likely setting off alarm bells.

And where is this puzzle written down? In a safe? Folded in a book?
 A safety-deposit box? This is what I'm trying to avoid. I don't want something that can be lost, stolen, destroyed... and now in your example, gotten to work on by whoever has decided that my Bitcoin is worth figuring out the answers on this page. Oh, and by the way, we only need to figure out about 6 of the words, because we'll be able to brute-force the rest.

No offense, we all have different areas of comfort and do our best to come up with the best answers we can... but this solution sounds like an absolute nightmare. The last thing I want to do is put my family through a forced game of Memory Lane weeks or months after my death. And until then I can spend my time *hoping* that the hoops I've set up for them to jump through aren't too high. And that's the *best* possible scenario. I don't know how much you have, but is it enough for someone to want to steal? How many family members do you have? Could any one of them decide that solving the riddle privately would be much more profitable that solving it at the dinner table, and then having to share the inheritance with the other 6 people?",1526540212

The trip to Berlin really rattled my world, nowhere could anyone actually USE any crypto.  Ended up standing with the cloakroom people joking about the whole conference not making much sense. 

Bitcoin's original vision of peer to peer digital money is sound in my books, it's what will actually make a difference and make life a ton easier.  Sound economics will prevail, and with the right way of thinking to boot it's achievable.

"&gt; Well, I'm glad we agree that prices are being bid up right now by loans. I dont know how this supports your point, because if loans are harder to get, there will be less loans bidding the price up.

Oh, it doesn't have anything at all to do with the original point.  We just both seem annoyed by that fact.  I sold my house two a low income couple for 250k on a FHA loan and less than 8k spent to close.  I took that 250k and put it as a deposit on my current 500k house, earn like 5x what those buyers did combined, still worried about repaying it because I'm actually financially responsible, but couldn't qualify for a Fannie/Freddie backed loan anyhow and had to go hard money.  Fucking rage inducing stupidity all around.

&gt;My point with the hyperdeflation example, with people buying two homes a year from now is that affordability is not an issue when prices are constantly falling.

No way.  So lets assume this became a thing, because I've been slowly developing this line of thought the past few days if BTC did suddenly displace fiat as people here love saying.  BTC loans would be structured the opposite of how loans are now.  Rather then owing the same principal plus interest, your principal would deflate at a rate slower than actual BTC deflation rate.  After all they need to both make money, but still attract borrowers in the first place.  The problem is if that deflation rate does not stabilize and become much much more predictable, fuck all nobody is lending out money at a long term fixed rate.  Much how if the USD inflation rate were not stable, as is suggested in the original post, you would NOT be able to get a 30 year fixed rate mortgage like you can today.  Housing prices would behave similarly.  The prices would deflate at a slightly slower rate than the currency, much how real estate typically increases in value slightly outpacing inflation.",1526539111

"&gt; Idk about that one. Anything can happen, what if you crashed your car tomorrow and had brain damage and forgot literally everything? Chance is slim to none but still a possibility you should think about, especially with your assets.

I didn't say this in the original post because I thought it might complicate matters. But that's a good point, and it's exactly what prompted all of this thought process in the first place.

In other words, how to you leave someone Bitcoin that they can *only* access if you are dead?

Well, the first step would be making sure that there is nothing for them to steal from you. That means getting rid of any paper wallets or word seeds.

Second, you would need a person, or a service of some sort to deliver an encrypted message to the loved one in the event of your death. The message would have to be encrypted, because you could not trust any of the people involved (before or after your death). So you would want to have encrypted the 12-word seed for yourself (in case you forgot it) as I described in the original post... and you'd want to have the 12-word seed *also* encrypted with *their* public key for them to decrypt with their private key in the event of your death.",1526536709

"&gt; And it is also more than ironic how “on it” the SEC has been when it comes to crypto and all things ICO. Enforcement subpoenas are flying all around the United States in search of the next conviction. Ironic, because, of course, so little, comparatively, has been done similarly with regard to mainstream financial scams: The Great Recession is probably a perfect example. Crypto, while often ‘poo-poo’d’ as largely irrelevant and no threat, does appear to occupy more and more time and space in SEC moves.

&gt; In the interest of clarity and fairness, seeing as how the legacy financial world has been around decades and decades longer than crypto and ICOs, it’d be wonderful for the SEC to use some of this new found creativity to mock their own: investment bank come-ons, bail out scams, etc. We won’t be holding our breath.

Lets face it, unregulated, decentralised currencies would severely disrupt a centuries old institution - and that institution isn't about to let it happen.

The market is small enough for them to easily manipulate it and regulations in favour of the current status quo, would only make that manipulation easier. ",1526533408

As it stands, overwhelming consensus in the cryptocurrency community states:    

1. Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash are two separate cryptocurrencies.     

2. BTC and BCH are the ticker symbols representing Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash respectively.   


Because of this overwhelming consensus, it is reasonable to conclude anyone who wishes to honestly pair the ticker symbol along side the name of a cryptocurrency would do so in the way the overwhelming majority has already agreed upon. Which is:   
  
Bitcoin (BTC)    
Bitcoin Cash (BCH)

There are other coins and perhaps new coins that have not been invented yet that will be used as an alternative currency that is certain, however Bitcoin is not going to be that.",1526531162

But hey we're all trying to make money so who am I to judge.

It is a knock off but he doesn't spend time on it. Someone in the community started the project and they are taking the lead. It is actually going really well. The main goal of this is NOT to make money. It is a proof-of-concept for 

a) to show the network won't get clogged unlike ETH.

b) developing games on blockchain

c) developing games with their scripting language called CX. It is far easier to learn and if you know Go already it will only take a few minutes to understand the differences and start coding (supposedly, I am not a technical person) 

d) Developing and demonstrating use cases for their secondary token called Coin Hours. It is sort of like a NEO/GAS except it is an self-adjusting de/inflating token. I can type a massive paragraph explaining the economic reason for this but perhaps not now. 

&gt; Oh and they were about to get listed until all this bad stuff happened to the industry and they couldn't. Sounds like a cop out.

It isn't a cop out. It is actually one of the biggest problem of Skycoin and he knows it. The community were TOO decentralised and were all anonymous for many years until recently they realised marketing CANNOT be decentralised. It is actually one of the biggest red flag for Skycoin. However, in the past few months they have improved this like there is no tomorrow. They have already set up centralised offices in a few different cities with the Shanghai one being the HQ. They organised a massive conference with 600 people last month and many STATE medias were present. They are seriously getting their shit together. 

Fun fact, the CTO of Bittrex used to contribute to Skycoin's code on Github. So many veterans in the industry actually have contributed to Skycoin. They were never listed on Bittrex because they were too disorganised until recently. Now they finally have project managers that actually try to get Skycoin listed. 

&gt; Lastly, I didn't like the fact that he mentioned how ""all these crypto billionaires"" are just buying up Skycoin right now and there's no volume because no one wants to sell. Its a $218M market cap right now, that's nice but doesn't sound like mega whales coming in and buying up if you ask me.

They are buying OTC. 

&gt; The tech sounds cool but I have a hard time seeing it coming to fruition any time soon. But maybe its just a long play.

Long play for sure. However, the Skywire testnet is launching in a week and within a month or two we will all see how powerful it is (or not, who knows :)) ",1526530518

BCH's ledger has never had a majority approval of the measurable work capacity.

Then BTC will no longer be supported by the majority consensus and it will no longer exhibit _soundness_.  Irratic block discovery would be the least of the problems for that chain.

If the new majority chain is forked from BTC _with the immediate consensus of the majority work capacity_ then that chain will exhibit _soundness_. If the majority of work capacity abandons prior consensus in support of an alternate history, the work providers will have broken the property of _honesty_ and no chain extended by their work will be sound.

If you mean ""get 32 mb blocks now and then go back to smaller blocks later"" -- (I don't think that's what you mean btw, but if it is) -- it can't work because all changes to bitcoin have to be backwards compatible. Once you allow miners to do 32 mb blocks you can never take it back without their consent (that's what consensus means) and they will never agree to roll it back because bigger blocks are more profitable than smaller blocks.

As a result, you ""waste an upgrade."" Bitcoin upgrades are hard to do because you can never roll them back to put in better code. All Bitcoin solutions have to be long term. Once they are in the network, they are there forever.

Eventually we plan to implement bigger blocks. Actually we did implement significantly bigger blocks recently -- segwit created the possibility for up to ~3.9 mb blocks, and if it ever hits close to 100% adoption blocks should regularly be between 2 and 3 megabytes. And like other upgrades, it can never be reversed due to the immutability of the bitcoin blockchain. That's why we don't want to ""waste"" upgrades. When we have lots of other upgrades to put in at the same time, well implement bigger blocks as needed. But bitcoin isn't ready for that yet because important technologies for scaling up and remaining decentralized are not yet in place.",1526526862

"Kind of disagree with this.  Most of these things aren't adoption, just new ways to bet on the price.  Real adoption would move the price upwards.  Actual usability has gone backwards over the last year as Bitcoin has lost merchants.  Coinbase isn't even taking new merchant accounts.  Bitpay is the only US processor that has ACH, and it's not compatible with half the wallets now.

I used to pay for almost all my online purchases with Bitcoin, Newegg, Overstock, Steam, but not for a while now.

With bitcoin, the costs are a constant, whether there is coins being transferred or not. Mining simply cannot stop, otherwise it would jeopardise the network security. 
Also, miners are constantly adding more and more hash to the network, increasing the energy consumption, while the difficulty algorithm increases the difficulty, to keep a deterministic and controlled bitcoin inflation. This means the Bitcoin mining energy costs increases with the increase of the hashrate and also, with the halving of the bitcoin mining reward.

The equipment they are using is incredibly efficient. They use a fuck ton of electricity, but general purpose computers would use exponentially more electricity in order to accomplish the same work.

Once the block rewards end they will be replaced by network fees. If Bitcoin is able to survive that long it will need to increase the blocksize high enough where the fees can support mining. They have about 100 years before the reward disappear

Do this with a small amount (perhaps even less than $10 so you get comfortable handling your crypto.

"First Principles \- why not Bitcoin Cash.  Bitcoin's \(BTC\) value is obvious. It has the longest legacy and is ubiquitous.  Bitcoin's development team has done an abysmal job at making even the most trivial changes to make the Bitcoin network more convenient for it's users.

Politics, fundamentalism, and idealistic objections aside BCH presented a possible practical solution for Bitcoin's congestion problem. However, the terms by which conflicts would be resolved was agreed upon before the first Bitcoin block was ever minted.  That this arrangement could potentially lead to contention between the interests of miners and the rest of the community was therefore understood, and agreed upon by all.  That the community rejected BCH's solution allows us to consider the matter resolved:  those proposed changes exist on an altcoin that share some lineage with bitcoin but is henceforth another coin entirely.

Another altcoin also exists expressly for the purpose of incremental improvements or otherwise experimental features to the Bitcoin framework. Litecoin.  There are many coins, on paper, technically superior to both BCash and Litecoin, however, Litecoin occupies the niche that BCH is claiming to step into.  More generally, it is incumbent on any Bitcoin fork to demonstrate objective and significant advantages over Litecoin when proposing incremental changes to Bitcoin to add legitimate value to the cryptospace.

Of the 1600 coins traded today, some tiny number of them have a future. Perhaps Bitcoin is among them. Among the ones making incremental changes to Bitcoin, Litecoin has some seniority \(for whatever that's worth\).  Bitcoin Cash squarely falls between two stools.  By Bitcoin Law, it is a rejected faction.  Among the world of altcoins it is an incremental improvement of Bitcoin inferior in many regards to many other alts.  It's only grace is that it was free \(pro gratis\), and widely distributed.  Except for this fact , BCH has no quality or feature making it inherently more valuable than any of \~1,000 other alts.

"There is an open debate about whether cryptos are currencies, securities or something else entirely. The point is that it is not yet settled with a consensus view.

It sounds like your position is that it is a currency and like cash deposits in a saving account, it should be free and maybe even earning interest. It's free in a currency situation because the deposits become part of the allowed capital base for the bank, i.e. they can lend your money out to earn revenue from it. The money they make from your cash is greater than their cost of maintaining your account.

There is also a camp that considers crypto to be a security, so lets compare it to the current model on securities ownership. A holder of shares/bonds/units etc. does not actually physically take possession of a 'share certificate' because in many countries it doesn't actually exist in a physical form. So the investor leaves it with a custodian (who usually also happens to be the broker). Unlike cash, securities cannot be used by the broker/custodian for their own gain (unless you specifically enter into a stock borrow/loan arrangement). This is why they charge a custodian fee.

You don't have to agree with it, but purely from a business perspective, there is a market that needs this service and is willing to pay for it.

"&gt;They can put whatever spin they like

Yes this is my point.

&gt;but I think the idea that cryptocurrency is somehow socialist is fairly deluded.  

I don't think its especially delusional compared to projecting any other political belief onto a technology.

&gt;The whole notion of crypto-anarchy is inherently, unabashedly libertarian (I'm asking anyone in advance not to start talking about libertarian socialism as a gotcha, that's not what I mean by the term and you know it).

I actually wasn't aware of that philosophy and had a little read about it. I find it interesting so thanks for that. And no I am not here to say your view is wrong or conflate it with another philosophy, I am merely stating we all have biases based on our experiences and backgrounds and we should be critical of these biases before we project them onto things that are not political (ie a technology). You might ask well 'does it even matter?' and I would say it does since political beliefs and ideologies are polarizing which isn't good for adoption. An example would be the evidence around global warming, because its a politically charged topic, people willfully ignore the evidence even though its a very real threat. Saying that, I don't see the harm in acknowledging the libertarian roots of cryptocurrencies, but equally, we should be aware of how this space has evolved and become more inclusive and generalizable for all society and societal beliefs. 

&gt;I also think that development of the cryptocurrency space inevitably pushes us towards ends that are somewhat like crypto-anarchy 

I would agree and hope that is one result of cryptocurrencies and decentralization.

&gt;dialectic materialism

It doesn't make me wonder at all. And no, it's got nothing to do with ""censorship"" - Once you learn and understand the rules, you have no problems.

Let me give you an example, found it on Twitter but it's fantastic. If you go to a NASA symposium about global warming and you start shouting that the there is no global warming, you will be escorted out. At first maybe laughed at, but then you'll be kicked out... possibly with force. Or how about an NRA conference, and someone shouting about gun control?

This product is the result of really about two months of part-time development, I have a ways to go, I told myself I'd commit about a year to it and see where it goes. I agree the screenshots and description need work, that's great advice. 

As for WHY you should use the app, I have a ton of really cool features planned. One of which is the ability to tip other users in the crypto-currency of your choice. This can lead to cross-pollination so to speak, where perhaps you're chatting with someone who's a Monero user but doesn't know much about the Lightning network for example. You could tip that user on the LN, this could lead to both of you learning more about how LN works and further driving adoption. 

I have a feature planned that will allow you to type a phone number  in, tip that phone number with any currency you want, and then that phone number will get a text. Obviously they'll have to sign up (Good for user adoption) but once they do, they'll have access to all their tips. 

This will essentially act as a new way to send crypto, as well as a way to drive user adoption and build a better network.

"Fundamental chart on Marketcap vs transactions and active adresses for different coins

https://imgur.com/a/0aNAIpI

The chart is built so that Bitcoin stays around 1, to see when it was at its cheapest and most expensive based on price vs use. So all the factors and powers are chosen for Bitcoin. Later I added coins and used the same numbers to compare. The tops and bottoms of the largest Bitcoin bubbles is also in the chart.

Would like you guys's views and observations of the chart.

Exact formula: value = ((Monthly average Marketcap(bill)/10)/((Monthly average daily active adresses(k)/200 + Monthly average daily transactions(k)/100)/2))2,4

We could go back and forth with this all day. If you plan on storing something generally it's understood to be long term. In the short term there are obviously much more stable alternatives but historically speaking nothing has ever come close to being as powerful a long term investment as bitcoin. In the frame of reference it has only ever outperformed ever other asset.

Take the world, remove all the government, legislation and rules and you get anarchy. That anarchy would eventually develop power structures and frameworks.

We agree that the state provides roads, protects our water supply/environment (mostly) and prevents citizens from developing nuclear weapons.

It's tough to be 'creative' when you have to pay all your money/crypto to the warlord who controls the water and the roads. It's hard to be safe when your thuggish neighbours extort you with weapons or monopolies.

Libertarians (and I was one for a time) draw an arbitrary line between between the government and the private sector the lay they like. They disregard that society (individuals en masse) already did that, and the line is in a slightly different place that the one that suits you. Tough.

"Let's pretend that this was an honest question.

BCH blocks are teeny\-weenie because it has very low transaction volume, so allowing them to get bigger is meaningless. 

[https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/bitcoin&amp;#37;20cash\-size.html](https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/bitcoin%20cash-size.html)

While increasing the BCH block size does nothing for BCH users \(they don't get faster, cheaper or more secure\), it does increase the burden on folks running the network \(potentially pricing some potential node operators out of the network and increasing centralization\).

The BTC network has added raw transaction capacity \(because of SegWit adoption, which is up to about 35&amp;#37;\). Once we hit \~99&amp;#37; SegWit adoption the total number of transactions per block should be \~12,000, versus \~5000 without SegWit \(just a ballpark \- I'm sure someone smart will check this for us, if it matters\).

Look at the ""SegWit Usage"" tab here for the adoption curve: [https://oxt.me/charts](https://oxt.me/charts).

My estimation is that the BTC network should be able to handle approximately 50&amp;#37; more transactions now than it could in December/Jan.

However, we are also seeing that better fee estimation by clients is improving the user experience: users are starting to choose when they should pay more for fast confirmations versus paying less for slower confirmations \(many folks thought that large BTC quantity transactions should cost more, and small less \- they didn't understand that the price is for confirmation speed, not quantity\). Wallets \(and exchanges\) are getting better at helping people with this, which was a huge source of the dissatisfaction that lead people to naively assume that there was a profound 'scalability' problem, even thought that might not have been the case.

In any case, current BTC transaction volumes are pretty low and it's possible to get a 1 sat/byte transaction confirmed in 2 blocks fairly consistently right now. It is still amusing how much some folks are offering in fees for some transactions \- I really don't know why. Maybe they think they have to?

"In the legal sense all that needs to be satisfied is burden of proof. A government will recognize court decisions based in that and anyone found to be in contention of the law is subject to the actions and punishments of law enforcement. If you can prove beyond reasonable doubt that you own the coins associated to a certain address then you are protected to whatever extent your government / bitcoin custodian / insurer will cover. The concept of ownership does not work without proof in the form of a trusted registry that (the majority of) people and organisations reference to obtain the information of what belongs to who. That's why credit networks are possible in the first place. So to actually prove owneship of bitcoin in a *legal* reference you need to follow certain paths and procedures to ensure you have a trustworthy custodian (like an exchange with KYC /AML) which provides court credible witness evidence to support any claim of ownership you might have to or want to make in the future. 
 
 In terms of what constitutes the ideological 'ownership' of the balance of an address... That's more of a moral concern. Your ownership of anything physical or digital inherently relies on who recognizes that you own it legally or otherwise. Just because the ledger is public does not mean it isn't covered by the same property rights whether civil / legal justice is concerned *and* on moral grounds. You can rob a private ledger (bank / VISA) by hacking into the system controlling it and maliciously changing inputs.. This is virtually the same.",1526512848

"Jesus.

At what point did I say fiat pairings would lead to a bullrun? When has that ever been even remotely said?

I haven’t even asked for more fiat pairings for that matter. Are you actually reading what you’re responding to?

Measuring alts in satoshis only happens because btc is the primary trading pair. 

My statement is: Using a completely unrelated cryptocurrency (bitcoin or any other for that matter) as a measuring stick for another crypto’s evaluation is fundamentally flawed. Using a completely unstable cryptocurrency that is only used for the purpose of trading “for profits” is a ludicrous long term plan in a market of impressive emerging technology with people looking to invest. 

Projects need to be valued by the actual native currency that all “value” is actually realized in, fiat.

So I’ll try this one more time. Imagine, ZERO trading pairs other than a single cryptocurrency or “credit” that is applied to your personal exchange account when entering fiat into the crypto market. That “credit” is 1 for 1 on your fiat usd. Now go buy whatever crypto you want. If something like this ever came to fruition you’d actually have real valuations that fluctuate based on fundamentals and financial market ups and downs not “hey fam who are these whales dumping btc?” or “when alt moon after btc bullrun?”

For the love of god please don’t try to teach me how alts are measured in satoshi again. Just because something is done a certain way does not mean it should continue being done a certain way. Disagreeing with the way something is done does not mean i don’t understand how or why what’s being done is being done. 

",1526512459
"Ok, so first off, sats is the smallest unit of measurement for BTC.  Not ETH.

Second - you're not following.  You need to stop thinking about fiat value.  It doesn't matter any more.  Your goal is to increase your holding of ETH.  You successfully did this, just not by nearly as much as you thought, and I think this is why:

The value of your alt changed from $0.05 to $0.06 and you are trying to base your calculation off of that.  That is wrong.  The actual value is much more specific than that.  A change from 7830 to 7949 ETH might only be the difference between $0.054 and $0.055 because the fiat value is always going to be rounded to the nearest cent.  

What matters is that you bought at 0.00007830 and sold at 0.00007949 for a gain of 0.00000119 ETH per unit.  You must have had about 1400 units because your total ETH increased by 0.00162840 ETH total, which is roughly $1.15.

Bitcoin offers a decentralised transparent solution and it's worth is backed by both users believing in it and the work that goes into keeping the blockchain operational and the power it takes to do that.

"Again, I'm not arguing about current block sizes (or even the next 10 years). I'm arguing about future block sizes, if we are going to have the kind of economic activity which I expect we will, will simply not be physically possible to put every transaction in the blockchain.

I can run a full BCH node now, for sure, but the roadmap of BCH means that I won't be able to run one at some point in the future, nor will most people. There will be a barrier of entry into the space, where you will need a large amount of capital to start some kinds of blockchain related businesses. (Compared to a tiny computer and internet connection needed to make a Bitcoin related business - as hundreds of people have done in the past 8 years).

But again, I don't think that it is even physically possible to build servers capable of the levels of scaling we could have. People advocating big blocks are trying to achieve Visa kind of levels of scaling, where I suspect actual scaling requirements are going to be several orders of magnitude larger.

The reason I use Bitcoin rather than Bitcoin Cash is because I don't see a future for Bitcoin Cash. I don't necessarily see a future for Bitcoin either, if it intends to *never* increase its block size to meet a demand that will be necessary, with the various 2nd layer solutions.

But I do see a future for various second layer solutions (on whatever underlying platform), which can provide massive amounts of scaling without requiring everything be put into a massively redundant global ledger (which is also harmful for privacy). I work on LN, not because I'm distracted by Core propaganda, but because I see it as the best option we have of getting microtransactions at massive scale.

Yes that was my point. That crypto has evolved much beyond bitcoin and they should not be pegged to satoshi value. BTC has its own stuff going in the future market and it should not affect value of other coins. I strongly believe that one day we will get rid of BTC value dependency. ,1526510294

I actually would prefer a completely autonomous system that just worked all on its own. That was completely private yad yad yad. All those things are very admirable but I just don't think it will happen.. not wide spread. 

There are also many negative affects that come from it as well. Thing like the Silk Road are a great example. Not to mention the mess that bitcoin has with centralized miners controlling the price of bitcoin. 

On the other hand I don't see why anyone would think ripple themselves would intentionally drive down the value of their own product. None the less.. you are right. Any of those things could happen.",1526510293

"&gt; &gt;  LN, not Bitcoin Network. LN is not as secure as the Bitcoin Network.
&gt; 
&gt; In some manners LN is more secure than onchain and vice versa 

Yeah, in some respects they're more secure on LN because you would need to wait for the timeout. LOL.

&gt; &gt;You sure about that? At a minimum every node along the route knows how much was transferred. It's currently a bunch of hubs, so how is that more private?

&gt; Those txs are permanently stored on a blockchain for coin analysis. 

But your name and IP address are not. There are many obfuscation methods available, you can find out how to remain anonymous with just a small amount of research.

&gt;LN uses tor onion routing by default as well and is multihop. You don't need to connect to any large LN channels either 

I'm laughing anytime someone mentions TOR. For a better explanation then I can give about why this is bullshit, watch this video:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgts1qb0hLY

I would like to see you try to debunk that.

&gt; &gt;From one node to another node, not from a million interconnected nodes, that would hard crash any modern computer.
&gt; 
&gt; No , not from one to another , the TPS I cite is network wide . You do not need to have millions of open channels , just one well connected , or a couple less connected ... you keep ignoring that LN is multihop 

So, you're telling me that a cell phone, or even an entry-level laptop, can keep track of the state of 1 million open channels?

Are you insane?

&gt; &gt;The nodes between you and your transactions destination are literally middlemen!
&gt; 
&gt; these middleman cannot censor your tx like bitpay and coinbase are doing right now

They literally can if they don't have enough funds, or they transfer funds at the same time you send your transaction.

&gt; &gt;Add in the open and close transaction, and you would have to do about 14 LN transactions PER CHANNEL for it to be cheaper than a the same amount of BCH transactions. 
&gt; 
&gt; I spend 4 us pennies to load my channel and now can perform as many LN channels as I wish . 

And I spend literally that much for 8 on-chain Bitcoin Cash transactions.

&gt;Few people will need to close channels and I can fund channels without any direct onchain tx as well 

Few people will be able to have an always-on device to keep track of their $5 worth of BTC.

Hell, few people actually have money in the bank, what makes you think they're going to want to keep that money in a channel? Most people spend every dollar they have, then spend more, it's called credit.",1526510278

\&gt; I'm not inherently against blocks bigger than 4MB, or even 32MB is not really a problem either. GB blocks are. 

Sure, but why? this was never a problem when btc was working fine 4 years ago, and hard disk space and internet speed has got better at the same rate as before. why is a big blockchain such a big deal, I simply don't get it? And why should everyone be running their own nodes anyway? And if you want to, what's stopping you exactly? blocks aren't big enough yet, but LN is already leaking out its plethora of centralization problems. What would you say the answer is here?

\&gt; Ok, So I'm a developer, I work on something LN related, and I disagree with the Bitcoin Cash approach to scaling, as I need to run a full node for various purposes, and I'm certainly not rich enough to run and maintain a massive server to run a full node. 

You're getting distracted by core propaganda, and I don't use these jingoistic terms losely. the people who choose to run their full nodes for business purposed will have no problem doing so with bch, the same as btc. Noone's stopping you from running your node if you want, that part works the same, and, the blocks aren't big enough to make the case for unsustainable growth, neither in btc nor bch. So how is this arbitrary reason of blocksize such a big hurdle in people using bch? ",1526508335

"**Poisson point process**

In probability, statistics and related fields, a Poisson point process or Poisson process (also called a Poisson random measure, Poisson random point field or Poisson point field) is a type of random mathematical object that consists of points randomly located on a mathematical space. The point process has convenient mathematical properties, which has led to it being frequently defined in Euclidean space and used as a mathematical model for seemingly random processes in numerous disciplines such as astronomy, biology, ecology, geology, physics, economics, image processing, and telecommunications.

The Poisson point process is often defined on the real line, where it can be considered as a stochastic process. In this setting, it is used, for example, in queueing theory  to model random events, such as the arrival of customers at a store or phone calls at an exchange, distributed in time.

&gt; will contribute some amount of effort into the network to try and secure it, even if it's not profitable to do so, but because not doing so means they'll lose their savings

Those seem contradictory to me.

In this hypothetical future of yours, there will be no incentive to mine. In fact, you even say there will be *disincentives*! It won't be profitable. People will mine the bare minimum - after all, why would you want to burn more money than you really need to?

That will incentivize large criminal organizations to secretly build up mining hardware, then suddenly turn everything on in attempts to overpower the bare minimum. The incentives of this are huge: control of the world's money supply!

And no, LN is not Bitcoin. Why would people measure things in BTC when it's slow, expensive, unreliable? No, in your future, people will measure things in Dogecoin. It's faster and cheaper, and fully compatible with LN - and after people start mining on BTC at the bare minimum, Dogecoin will quickly gain more POW.

That's not because the technology is somehow more magical or anything, that's simply because the owner of the bot decided to accept 0-conf transactions as valid. But this is a risk the them as 0-conf txs *can be double spent*. Don't believe me, see for yourself [here](https://doublespend.cash) - It's a website that tracks double spend attempts and successes. This is the reason why Bitcoin supporters keep saying 0-conf is not secure.

Don't know which wallet you used, but most wallets that support BCH support BTC as well... so the argument is moot.

If you are dealing with merchants that are happy to take the risk of a double spend, then any blockchain will give you the same experience. Including Bitcoin. I've personally made many payments where the merchant immediately detected that my payment has been sent... but then requested that I wait for at least one confirmation. Double spend risk is the reason why, and it won't be any different with BCH.

"&gt; I'm just talking about incentive structure. 

1) Sure - they plan to make money on side chains.

2) No. Sidechains has many different selling points besides possibly cheap tx. First, the solution to cheap tx' is LN. and while blockstream might be considered experts here and can profit from consulting, its an open protocol, and there are at least 2 other competing here, so this seems kind of like a shaky business model at best. Second, the sidechains that are so far available are Liquid and the elements frame work (which is open source to build whatever sidechain you like) - Liquid's selling point has nothing to do with on-chain scaling, but is to solve a problem exchanges have with confirmation time. With elements you can argue that they will take fees for consulting, and you'd be correct, but I really don't see consulting for most likely proprietary sidechains is really problematic as the business case here most likely doesn't have anything to do with fees anyways, and more to do with features not  easily done on the blockchain.

3) I don't believe sidechains successes will be because of incentives to move tx' offchain (because fees right). Sidechains selling points is rapidly deploying features that are not possible on-chain.

&gt;  I'm simply pointing out the facts and the observations on the incentive structure.

I'm just not convinced by this. Here are blockstreams ""products"": https://blockstream.com/technology/

- LN is a huge endeavour being undertaken by the whole bitcoin community right now. This is not just some blockstream idea
- Liquid makes much sense with or without small blocks
- the satellite (have no idea how they're going to make money off this, but it is pretty cool to bring blocks across censored parts of the world)
- elements (this is open source)

&gt; ""Would Blockstream benefit if they could spend all their money coming up with an on-chain scaling solution, when everything happens on-chain is out of their control?""

As the only thing I can see them directly making money from is Liquid (and that has its completely own use case regardless of blocksize) I'd have to say yes (as in it'd be neutral). They can make money consulting for stuff that goes on onchain as well as offchain. Now ask yourself this: ""if they plan to make money consulting, does it matter if its for stuff on-chain or off-chain""?",1526506743

"Sure,

Basically Coin-Age algorithm gives the highest priority to coins that have been lying dormant for longer amount of time. The longer, the better.

Miners (should)prefer transactions with highest priority (oldest) for inclusion in blocks, which automatically slows down (or even stops) any spam attacks based on re-sending the same coins over and over. It also makes them expensive, because to incentivize a miner to take your TX with fresh coins (low priority) into a block you have to offer something extra (higher fee), which makes using fresh coins (and thus spam attacks) expensive.

Coin Age also potentially allows of sending high priority transactions for free, assuming there is 5% space for free transactions in each block (it was discussed here a lot) .

Before Bitcoin Core 0.12, coin age was default policy of Bitcoin clients.

"Ok, So I'm a developer, I work on something LN related, and I disagree with the Bitcoin Cash approach to scaling, as I need to run a full node for various purposes, and I'm certainly not rich enough to run and maintain a massive server to run a full node.

Does that make me a sheep?

The sheep mentality appears much more on the other side of the debate from what I see. There's very little technical discussion, lots of propaganda and deceitful behavior, and from what I see, no actual solution to scaling. I'm not inherently against blocks bigger than 4MB, or even 32MB is not really a problem either. GB blocks are.

I don't want to see just ""visa levels"" of scaling. I want every human, all 8 billion of them by the time this will be global, to be able to conduct tens of microtransactions per minute, as a means to pay content creators for the works they publish directly, without some label taking a cut, and without me giving up privacy to third-party advertisers whom I never invited into my transactions, but who forced their way in. The advertising model on the web is on its way out, and we have an opportunity to replace it if we can get microtransactions working right. (And I mean fraction of a cent transactions, with negligible fees).

If you think that can be achieved by keeping transactions on chain, get back to your calculator and keep trying. It's not possible, it's not desirable either.",1526505958

You just have said #4, which means you are just another person, on-repeat, not thinking for themselves, reciting the same talking points you can find all over reddit, twitter, etc.",1526505896

In some manners LN is more secure than onchain and vice versa 

&gt;You sure about that? At a minimum every node along the route knows how much was transferred. It's currently a bunch of hubs, so how is that more private?

Those txs are permanently stored on a blockchain for coin analysis. LN uses tor onion routing by default as well and is multihop. You don't need to connect to any large LN channels either 

&gt;From one node to another node, not from a million interconnected nodes, that would hard crash any modern computer.

these middleman cannot censor your tx like bitpay and coinbase are doing right now

Totally. That has been the opinion I formed as well. I guess I was just thinking from a personal perspective because if I created something I would want to promote that.

What I don't get is why r/bch hasn't been created.

Halong mining is still a giant mystery, even months after announcing their miners; everything to do with the company and their ""customers"" is hugely suspicious.

* The reseller listings are scant and suspicious in themselves, tons of scammy looking accounts with no real history behind them.

* All the reviews come from absolute nobodies or ""verified accounts"" and I can't find a single teardown review from the people you would expect them from, or a single video dismantling a unit so we can see how they're built.

* Ckpool, Slushpool, BitFury, and F2Pool have all been vocally anti-BCH and have openly associated themselves with Blockstream and Bitcoin Core, so the fact these are the only pools which ""support ASICBoost"" is massively strange.

* All of the freely available data on the Dragonmint miners and overt ASICBoost is either easily faked (such as the videos on the miners, or the website you linked) or totally contradictory (such as your question above).

"Nobody ""pays for miners to secure the network"". Miners opt-in to secure the network with the expectation of profitability. If it's not profitable, they'll stop mining, the difficulty will drop, and the miners who stuck at it might earn more.

Mining is a risky investment. Nobody knows whether it will forever be profitable on any network once the subsidy is gone. 

The expectation is that the network will be so massive by then that everyone with a stake in the game will contribute some amount of effort into the network to try and secure it, even if it's not profitable to do so, but because not doing so means they'll lose their savings.  If you had say, 4 billion people running a mining device consuming about 10W of energy, they will write it off as a kind of necessary utility, because it's a negligible amount of money in electricity for securing their money.

If LN sees widespread adoption, it's still Bitcoin, and people will use it because people will want to put their investments and savings into the currency which has the greatest PoW effort securing it. You might be able to atomic swap to other currencies, but these will always be valued in terms of Bitcoin, not the other way round.

"So for anyone that is interested it looks like it was hacked using a wallet file put on my computer at some point. The receiving address I had in the wallet was one that the private key is available publically. 

The address the bitcoins were sent still has them unspent, along with another smaller amount from a different address. 

Now this is the interesting bit, the address the smaller amount was sent from has been used by a well known scammer

the address I sent the coins to is 

1GYFF26ZNohcFXNPPgrcovQH2XPvG38y7h

the private key is available if you google the address. 

the other address that sent the smaller amount is 

1DxzwX4qC9PsWDSAzuWbJRzEwdGx3n9CJB

and the wallet where the funds are still being held is 

3JCr7NNUgDifZ8ao33eg3CD2RFu5L54y1S

. I imagine it's all bot controlled and will be moved quickly from there and split up loads of times like I've seen with other scamming transactions but for now, it's just sat there. 

Lesson learned, stop doing anything crypto related on OSX . 

If whoever you are that set this up is here reading this, thanks for teaching me yet again not to trust anyone or anything on the internet. probably not a large amount of money in terms of your whole setup but it screwed me over for the week!

1NKnBjuDvYWCh1PQPMD9ynGLJ1tixWNHyR

Still would like to know how the wallet got swapped on my computer so anyone that has an idea, please pitch in. 

Here's the post I found where this happened to someone else and how I found out.

"I'm going to share a personal experience. I have never been banned from r/bitcoin. I have however been banned from following Bitcoin cash news and Rodger ver on Twitter simply because I used the word bcash. Now I'm going to give you a little back history on this. I actually haven't been in the crypto space that long and was under the impression that's what it was actually called. Like an abbreviation. Had no idea it was viewed as a bad word. That happened maybe a week or two after I got into crypto which shows you I have less than a year of actual experience. I do believe I was accused of being a shill because I asked a very simple question. Why are the products not marketed independently? If Bitcoin cash is better why am I reading so much marketing and so little technology? It was a comment about like that. Keep in mind I literally had a few weeks of experience here. 

Moving on to present tense and the whole reason I decided to come in here and see what was going on. Years ago I worked in securities. The majority of my trading ideas came from doing research and talking to people. Naturally that's how I began to learn about crypto. After realizing it had been right in front of me for the past 10 years... like not even kidding here. Virtual game currency and emerging technology are my thing. For some reason I Associated Bitcoin with drug dealing. Probably because of Ross. That ignorance cost me. Anyway not to ramble but as someone relatively new to the space I think a more positive outlook and less bashing would do the Bitcoin cash brand a lot of good. Take that for what you will",1526504244

"I think 'why' is quite obvious. With standard fees and no limit, you know with a high degree of confidence that your transaction is going to get included in the next block. Bitcoin remains (or becomes) fire and forget. Implementing Layer-2 systems get far less tricky (w.r.t. timeouts, watchtowers, etc.). There is no need for fee guesstimating heuristics or tricks like replace-by-fee. High usage of Bitcoin directly translates into higher blockchain security. The question of future rewards for mining is resolved. Mempool becomes a flat map of the new block and allows straightforward bandwidth optimizations. On the bigger end of the block size debate, you don't rely on deals between miners in order to keep fees in check or to prevent a 'poison block' DoS scenario. And so on...

I see the benefits of allowing some free transactions, but they remain moot, especially in the case of a limited block size. Satoshi lacked real usage data in order to come up with a good enough consensus rule for fees, and to be honest we still don't know enough to come up with an adaptive routine that would work indefinitely, but to me the benefits of the paradigm (compared to the block size limit) is rather evident.

(At this point I re-read your question, and maybe you meant the 'why' for free transactions rather than my proposal of standard fees. If so, the answer as it applies today would be to allow people without additional funds to free stuck UTXO's.)

Regarding the other question, since throughput is constant, when an old transaction with a lower fee gets confirmed, it means a higher fee transaction is delayed. Whether your transactions will bubble up too quickly depends on how much of a legitimate queue there is. The critical point of entry (if there is one) for the attacker depends on the users' behaviour, so I haven't really been able to come up with a good simulation to predict useful numbers. Maybe the next crisis can produce enough data to analyze, so I'll leave it there.

What? Why would they ever swap? What I find confusing is there isn't r/bch or r/bitcoincash. If the group is primarily about Bitcoin cash why was its own subreddit never created?

I'm not a religious zealot and I actually own both major forks of Bitcoin along with Bitcoin itself. I just think this trying to take over the Bitcoin name thing is causing Bitcoin cash more harm than good for a variety of reasons. Amplifying the hostilities between the two groups being one of them. That's not healthy for either group. If you guys have just became religious zealots that's fine I can find my way out of this subreddit it just makes supporting the coin that much harder if it's being ran by fanatics.

I have read it but it still doesn't address my initial comment. I'm going to assume your focus is on the peer-to-peer cash sentence. I'm going to assume that right now you're referring to the fact that if a lot of people get on the Bitcoin Network the fees get pretty high. Isn't this the reason Litecoin was invented? I mean I'm not a religious zealot like some people who only believe in one coin. I actually own all three. I just think Bitcoin cash and Litecoin are extremely similar. I also think the infighting is ridiculous because like I said earlier you have crypto currency in its infancy. Maybe childhood years would be a better term. At any rate having people try different ideas to find out what works is very healthy. Having everyone support just Bitcoin cash or everyone support just Bitcoin is not in any of our interests. You may also notice the supporters of Bitcoin also generally greatly support Litecoin. Why is that? Well it's not a hostile Fork. In my opinion the future of Bitcoin cash is much brighter if the Hostile Fork becomes a little less hostile and a little more intellectual. Develop the coin and let it Market itself.

"&gt;Meanwhile i uderstand that any type compression relays on more computation. I cant found something similar to Bitfure research what will describe situation as for now.

If there's ever a need for more computational power, we could also use GPU's to compute, if people can't afford Enterprise-level servers. We already know that they're very efficient at hashing. A modern GPU can do nearly a Billion hashes per second vs a modern CPU's ~50 million hashes/s. This doesn't equal transactions/s, but is a comparative measure.

I found this bit of (outdated) wisdom:

&gt;PayPal, in contrast, handled around 10 million transactions per day for an average of **115 tps** in late 2014.

&gt;Bitcoin is currently able (with a couple of simple optimizations that are prototyped but not merged yet) to perform around 8000 signature verifications per second on an quad core Intel Core i7-2670QM 2.2Ghz processor. The average number of inputs per transaction is around 2, so we must halve the rate. This means 4000 tps is easily achievable CPU-wise with a single fairly mainstream CPU.

&gt;as long as Bitcoin nodes are allowed to max out at least 4 cores of the machines they run on, we will not run out of CPU capacity for signature checking unless Bitcoin is handling 100 times as much traffic as PayPal.

&gt;https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Scalability

So, that (fairly old) processor can do around 11,500 TPS.

Furthermore, this is a laptop processor that goes for around $140, the current high end does about 4 times that:

https://www.cpubenchmark.net/compare/Intel-i7-2670QM-vs-Intel-i9-7980XE-vs-Intel-i7-3930K/878vs3092vs902

For comparison with the million hashes/s mentioned above, the 3930K does 66.6 million hashes/s. A modern GPU can do around 20 times as much, so potentially around half a million TPS or around 43 Billion transactions per day!

https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Non-specialized_hardware_comparison

&gt; &gt; with 8 MB blocks, you're actually transferring 16 MB worth of data every 10 minutes. (You receive all the transactions, then when the block is found you receive it whole.)
&gt; 
&gt;  isn't that countable by each connected peer, not summary? I cant say that i am prefectly understanding resource consumption by protocol, never was deeply studying it, cuz i am not working on protocol development, instead on ecosystem services. So i better listen or relay on some respectable researches, instead of giving some personal opinion.

You only receive a transaction once, but you can send it to up to however many peers you are connected to, which is configurable, so if you have a weak connection, you can limit the amount of connections. This wouldn't matter so much for a mining pool because they would likely have a 1-10 Gigabit line to deal with all of the individual miners anyway.

For example [BTC.com](https://pool.btc.com/pool-stats) has over half a million ""Workers online"" meaning their node(s) serve over half a million individual miners. (Not sure if that's miners or mining machines, probably the latter.)

&gt; &gt; So at this point bandwidth is not the bottleneck
&gt; 
&gt; Storage definetely also not the bottleneck. But what are cons of big blocks then  (beside backward compatability and computational latency issue)? There must be, otherwhise why to have limit at all. 

The Core arguments:

""To keep it decentralized"" ""So you can run a node on a raspberry pi"" 

The Cash arguments against:

""Blockstream is looking to implement their Sidechains that they charge fees to use."" 

""The banks are just trying to make Bitcoin unattractive, they're scared.""

""A bunch of people who don't know what they're talking about getting their information from Blockstream.""

&gt;It was invented to prevent spam, but this was long time before. How it is for now? As i told, i am not protocol developer, but those who are, have different opinions, i dont think that any of the side is completely wrong, there always are pros and cons.

The blocksize limit was put in place when transactions were still free, in order to limit disk space usage in case of a rare event where someone decides to just spam thousands of free transactions.

&gt;It's not a big deal if we reach the threshold.  **Free transactions would just take longer to get into a block.**

&gt;I did a rough tally of 4000 blocks from around 74000-78000.  This is excluding the block reward transactions:

&gt;There were average 2 transactions per block, 17 transactions per hour, 400 transactions per day.

&gt;Average transaction bytes per block was 428 bytes, or 214 bytes per transaction.

&gt;The current threshold is 200KB per block, or about 1000 transactions per block.  I think it should be lowered to 50KB per block.  **That would still be more than 100 times the average transactions per block.**

&gt;**The threshold can easily be changed in the future.  We can decide to increase it when the time comes.  It's a good idea to keep it lower as a circuit breaker and increase it as needed.  If we hit the threshold now, it would almost certainly be some kind of flood and not actual use.  Keeping the threshold lower would help limit the amount of wasted disk space in that event.**

It's clear that he meant for the limit to only effect free transactions. It's also clear that the limit was meant to be 100 times the daily transaction limit, *when transactions were free.* Now that there's a mandatory minimum fee to even have your transaction relayed to a miner, the limit is unneccessary.

&gt; In general, i accept both second-layer and big-block solutions, dont think they cannot exist simultaneously.  second-layer is similar model as it happened in internet networking ( https://qph.ec.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-26fe38f7f0ef1d8524552fa1dad3a7b2 )

I would welcome a good second layer solution, but as it stands today, and for the foreseeable future, LN is not the proper way to do it.

All of the current second layer solutions (Coinbase, tippr, etc.) require trust, and LN is currently no different. LN is just a giant Rube Goldberg Machine-type of software that doesn't even solve the problem of scaling that it intends to solve. LN is much harder to scale than the Bitcoin Network, and that's a fact.",1526503172

    Western District of Washington

And since you mentioned New Hampshire, that's under the 1st Circuit:
The United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit (in case citations, 1st Cir.) is a federal court with appellate jurisdiction over the district courts in the following districts:

    District of Maine
    District of Massachusetts
    ***District of New Hampshire***
    District of Puerto Rico
    District of Rhode Island

Didn't like that Rhode Island or Maine decision?  Too bad, the legal system makes you have to deal with it even if nothing like it ever was decided in New Hampshire.  (And it likely was, even if you insist it was not, because precedent.)

 
If you are pushng a case up through the court system on an issue that will likely argue the constitutionality of an issue, it won't necessarily protect you just because you live in, for example, Idaho, or Nevada, instead of California.

Don't get me wrong, I like free states.  I hope to retire in Idaho actually (but we'll see, I'm still open on the question of where I might ultimately retire - the country of Chile also looks pretty good, at least right now, due to its (lack of) bitcoin regulation - but that could easily change).

However, where states make laws (and especially where those laws are dubious, potentially unconstitutional, or just plain ridiculous), they will be challenged.  Where are those challenges heard?  The courts.

Some of this (court battles, etc.) can be avoided - and a lot of it has been avoided, in the case of bitcoin regulatory issues -  ***simply by defeating bitlicense (typically this emerges as proposals for state law or regulation) wherever it is proposed.***  That is why in New York, unfortunately, /u/theochino/ is still fighting away in NY courts battling bitlicense (and he deserves all the help he can get in the form of donations and other relevant assistance), and in states like California, we haven't had to challenge bitlicense in court, ***because we defeated it not once, but several times, before it ever was made law -- so it doesn't exist in California.*** But as I have also pointed out in the past, it is insufficient to merely wait for another bitlicense proposal to emerge and then struggle to beat it down again.  That's whack-a-mole. That's not an ideal strategy.  

That's why I also advocate for some sort of self-regulatory construct such as  a modified version of CCSS -- https://cryptoconsortium.org/standards/CCSS - to be utilized by exchanges (voluntarily) to promote security standards across the industry. Probably industry leaders have a different idea of what should be a good SRO or self-regulatory organizational structure, but having one that the exchanges all agree upon, and that governments also accept as a useful standard, would in fact keep states from attempting to advance more and more of these stupid bitlicense proposals. 

As we have seen, bitlicense has been adopted in New York - and NC -- and has been introduced in Connecticut, Hawaii, Nebraska, and Alaska. The Nebraska and Hawaii bitlicense proposals have been postponed for now.  But the Connecticut and Alaska ones are still very much active and deserve our advocacy against those proposals ***no matter what state we reside in.***

It's not sufficient to just tell people to ""move to state X"" when in fact the effect of bad policy in one or more states eventually bleeds over into other states.  We need to put a stop to bitlicense now.  This requires both legislative advocacy as well as our participation in the technical (coding) development of privacy enhancements to bitcoin and other similar systems.",1526502974

Let's just look at Satoshi's original concept. Rebuild the financial system with no centralized party in control to protect the innocent. So, by definition XRP may be a cryptographic-style asset. But, until Ripple Labs does not hold 61.2B of XRPs total tokens, they still have control enough to flood the market and tank the price as they choose. 

To that you may say that the 61.2B XRP is all held in ""Escrow"". But this ""escrow"" is merely a contract that only limits Ripple Labs to dump 1B XRP a week. Even at the height of the bull market where XRP hit 3.84 this would have been 3.84B USD in a week. I think a company of any size would be fine with income of 3.84B USD a year let alone a week.

"Same ownership rights as property. If I drop my gold by accident and you find it you don't autatically own it. Finders keepers is not going to fly in respect to property laws and the justice system. Proving ownership however can prove to be difficult. That's why insurance companies and banks offer protection by documenting your ownership of am insured item and buyimg you a new one if something bad happens to it or paying you the value of your loss. That's part of why FDIC makes saving money in a bank an attractive proposition for someone not looking to invest it. The reason most 'savings' accounts offer ~2% interest is to convince the person depositing money that their funds are not only secure with he bank but earning enough compound interest to shield the customer from the effects of inflation, as long as inflation remains stable.  

 Which brings us to the reasoning as to why a bitcoin bank is a good idea for a lot of ordinary people. If the bank insures your bitcoin deposit and protects it by documenting it's existance and that you are the declared owner. If it's stolen already (by you) that complicates things but people launder money through banks too so this is not a new problem.

More nuanced:

The primary property of a Nakamoto consensus system that makes its ledger suitable for use as money and its tokens for currency is its _soundness_, its ability to maintain a distributed ledger with future-consistency. The system must ensure, with justified high-probability, that a future observer's view of the ledger will be consistent with a present view. There are three complexly related factors which contribute to such a system's _soundness_:

* Work fitness. That the work performed can be suitably measured, the difficulty of the work scales appropriately to impeed the effectiveness of future work in manipulating prior record of the chain, and that reward for work is sufficient to consistently attract a majority of existing and new work capacity.

* Honesty of the work providers. Roughly, their history of maintaining consensus on a consistent ledger, within reasonable thresholds of the system's variance.

* Demonstrable consensus. Only through the accumulation of a majority share of measuable work proof can Nakamoto consensus reliably exprees majority consensus.

Between Nakamoto consensus systems sharing compatible work, especially when forked from a common genesis, accumulated work proof majority is _the_ determining factor on their relative _soundness_. All else being equal, the work fitness is identical. This may not be the case if, as you suggest. BCH's altred DAA is economically superior. However, if   future work capacity were to defect from the present consensus sufficiently for BCH to accumulate a majority of work proof, the providers would be violating the requirement of _honesty_. Neither system would have the quality of _soundness_. If the majority wants to gain the economic benefits of an improved DAA, the consensus signal acceptance of the change _without violating prior consensus_.

If BTC and BCH were not using compatible work, direct comparison of their accumulated work proof would be meaningless and their _soundness_ could be judged independently.  In that case other factors would take precedence - especially, but not limited to, their relative _work fitness_. Here the econonmic factors would have far more substantial influence on the comparable suitability between the two systems.",1526501290

Yes.

Well if they have access to the PK then they have access to your coins.

Own no, but you *could* access them and move them to a wallet/new private key then yes, they become yours.

If that were true, a chart of gold prices in USD should roughly match a chart of say, consumer price index. It doesn't at all, even looking over the last 10 years.

&gt; Your single cherry-picked example aside, on real timescales of &gt;10 years, gold and silver (and now crypto) hold value far better than something that falls a few % each year.

Yes, over long time scales gold will likely hold its value (in terms of real purchasing power) or even increase in value *on average*. Which is why it's a good store of value. I don't think crypto has been around long enough to confidently call it a store of value myself.

In the short term, gold's purchasing power fluctuates to a larger extent (and less predictably) than USD. Same thing for crypto, except much more dramatically. Which is why a gold-backed ""stablecoin"" isn't a very good stablecoin IMO, compared to a UDS-backed stablecoin.

I guess what I'm getting at is that being a good stable coin isn't necessarily the same thing as being a good store of value. A stablecoin just has to hold its value over short terms, because you shouldn't be holding large amounts of stablecoins for long periods of time in the first place (or at least I don't see why you would).",1526498982

&gt;IPv6 backward incompatible

True, but the point is it has been rolled out in a ""non-invasive"" way. Meaning you don't have to upgrade, and everything will keep working. This is not the case for Bitcoin, or Bitcoin Cash. Just look at yesterday's fork... ~18% of nodes are off the network! They have been cut off the network. And this is true for at least one miner as well. So **despite the incentives**, the network split. In addition, people trying to upgrade *now*, i.e. after the fork, are finding that the nodes don't sync!!! (Check it out on Github.) It should also convince you that ""incentives"" are just that... incentives. Does not mean people will *always* act accordingly.

This is not how an ""upgrade"" is supposed to happen, if network security and smooth operation are your primary concerns. Now look at the SegWit soft fork - Smooth AF. Zero interruptions for no one.

And no, the TCP/IP analogy is not terrible because that is exactly how the Bitcoin development is proceeding: Base layer/protocol + additional layers on top. This is the exact reason why development is ""slow"", because (robust) protocol development is intrinsically slow.

&gt;Soft forks have a tendency to make once simple things complex. That cost may, or may not be warranted.

"&gt; The answer is a resounding YES because:

No it's not. Requiring a large data center is a huge barrier to entry if you want to create a blockchain related business.

Since 2009, hundreds of people have created Bitcoin related businesses, and do research on the blockchain without any capital, because all they needed was a computer and an internet connection. By taking away the ability for anyone to enter the market unless that have large amounts of capital, your rate of innovation will stagnate pretty quickly.

It also means that the centralization will continue further, as larger miners will swallow up the smaller ones, and you won't get any new entrants to the market because it's too expensive to compete. An even bigger concern is that because the cost of running a full validating node is so large, miners won't even run one and will rely on a third-party to perform transaction validation, which is perhaps worse than centralization of mining power, because a bad actor could coerce a large portion of mining power to act dishonestly.

&gt;  Any other network topology other than a small world / complete graph is open to being Sybil attacked

The question is who is being sybil attacked. Sure, you'll struggle to attack the network as a whole and it's pretty much a non-issue for most networks with many well-connected users.

But *individual users* can be [eclipse attacked](https://eprint.iacr.org/2015/263.pdf), and your ""small world"" of miners does not help here, it makes it easier to pull off. The larger the diversity (as in, more nodes from mode distinct IP addresses) of validating nodes, the harder an eclipse attack would be to pull off. There are some other countermeasures to prevent eclipse attacks, such as connecting to ""well-known nodes"" (ie, single points of failure).

The kind of ""small world"" that will be required for gigantic blocks means that the computers performing validation will not only be owned by few people, they will be hosted in the same physical location, because the latency of block propagation means that they will not want the delays of sending them through the internet. Now you're vulnerable to whatever government has jurisdiction in that location.

&gt; Let 'a thousand bitcoins bloom' and the market will decide what to adopt and value. 

The market can only *decide what to adopt and value* if they are running software clients on the chain that they want to adopt. A lightweight client is not a client which decides which chain to adopt - it uses the chain which the nodes it connects to tell it to. If you only have miners running validating clients, and everyone else running lightweight clients, *the miners* decide the rules of the chain, not the market. (A user should not be expected to check the news and find out if there has been a hard fork recently before they can safely make a transaction).

&gt; You can run WWW/HTTP over any reliable/stateful protocol. Just like you can run Lightning/payment channels over any sufficiently adequate blockchain.

But that's not the argument we've been hearing. The crowd promoting BCH have been slagging of LN and it's developers the whole time. Now suddenly, after manipulating users to move away from BTC because ""lightning bad"", it becomes ""lightning OK"". Lets take the innovative work these people have been developing while simultaneously calling them incompetent.",1526496616
"&gt; This picture is not the network graph

Yes, its a visualization of all connections in the LN network. 

&gt; there are going to be larger and smaller nodes in any p2p topology

And in this case, 2-3 _incredibly_ big ones that a vast majority connects to.

&gt; Regulatory arbitrage applies

I think you are using words that you have no idea what so ever what they mean.

&gt; This is the same regulatory risk any network faces, yes even Bitcoin Cash.

With crypto, as it was conceived, there is no head, its a hydra. Which is why its been unstoppable. LN introduces a high degree of centralization which exposes the LN network to regulation.

&gt; where all SPV clients connect to 2 or 3 data centers
Running a LN node that ""everyone"" wants to connect to requires a _lot_ of funds. Incredibly low latency lines. High bandwidth. Uptime like nothing else. Running a SPV client is still as easy as butter, you need access to the blockchain and _something something_. That _something something_ needed for an SPV client is low tier stuff compared to running a healthy funded LN hub. So i will put running a SPV client in the same category as running a full node: its easy, cheap, low maintainance etc. Most important of all: The entire network doesn't stop/crash/freeze if you go offline. You are after all just a proxy to access the blockchain. If one of those two LN nodes go down the entire network is gridlocked. Contracts are frozen and will have to timeout, channels be closed, re-opened and god knows what until people can transfer funds again.

This new USD token will be trustworthy and stable and provide all the utility of crypto without having the worry of volitity.

"Your submission has been flagged for removal because it pertains to an incompatible derivative of Bitcoin commonly referred to as Bcash (BCH/BCC), or ‘Bitcoin Cash’. Prior to August 1st 2017, Bcash did not exist *(see:* [*“Bitcoin Cash Veers Off at Block Height 478558”*](https://archive.is/fCbpa)*)*. A small segment of miners decided to create an incompatible set of consensus rules based on Bitcoin’s existing network, and at block heigh 478559, Bcash was born. This method of copying an existing blockchain with no consensus among the existing network is commonly referred to as an airdrop. The Bcash token has become problematic primarily due to deceptive marketing practices portraying Bcash as if it were Bitcoin. But since Bcash is an merely impostor of Bitcoin, it really doesn’t belong in the Bitcoin subreddit. Therefore the /r/Bitcoin mod team (and readers) kindly ask you to post in a Bcash-oriented subreddit instead. Despite its misleading name, the /r/btc subreddit prides itself on welcoming all Bcash-related material (while ironically being anti-Bitcoin at the same time). Other subreddits which welcome Bcash-related material include /r/bcash and /r/bitcoincash. If you require assistance in claiming the Bcash airdrop or others, we recommend posting this to the /r/BitcoinAirdrops subreddit for more info. Thank you.

"I don't think atomic swaps necessarily increase demand for LTC moreso than BTC, but they do allow for greater interoperability, and greater liquidity for LTC/BTC pairing. 

LN's flaw (outside of temporary difficulty of use), is that moving from 1st layer to 2nd takes time. That process is essentially the same as a normal tx in terms of time and cost, which LTC still beats BTC at. 

Also, down the road, LN devs are looking to create a system where someone can send money on LN, and the receiver can receive payment onchain without opening/closing a channel (and vice versa). In that case, LTC will still settle payments faster. Also, if down the road BTC or LTC look to enable sidechains/smart contracts, then LTC should be able to handle the load better.

Not saying one kills the other, but that Litecoin will still exist as a faster and more lightweight option",1526494309

\- Then pretend that they each are processing the same BCH blocks

Therefore.... it is not a question of technical feasibility TODAY. It is then a question of whether ""this is a good thing"".

The answer is a resounding YES because:

\- Large data centers will have lobbying/political power

\- Large data centres are more resilient to attacks

\- Multiple large, well funded players have a vested interest in making things work well \(or if not, they can fork off and let the free market/genetic algorithm that is bitcoin protocol decide what's best\)

Besides:

\- Any other network topology other than a small world / complete graph is open to being Sybil attacked

\*bitcoin is a protocol for coordinating behaviours amongst a set of partipants \(via Nakamoto Consensus\) where at least 51&amp;#37; of them are acting in rational profit\-seeking self interest to ensure survival of the network\*

Let 'a thousand bitcoins bloom' and the market will decide what to adopt and value.  

Ethereum, and really any POW system is a variation of the 'bitcoin protocol'.  It may have a different hashing algorithm, name, or other qualities. But the fact remains it is a chain of digital signatures secured by blocks created via POW.

The beauty of Bitcoin is that it is as simple as it needs to be, and no more complex than it needs to be. \(At my current understanding\).   There is an irreducible beauty to it. 

Re: BTC vs BCH. 

If you are a builder/integrator/merchant, then the answer is clear what is 'bitcoin'. One can be used for commerce, micro payments, and is reliable with a plan for world wide scale.

Building ON\-TOP of bitcoin \(protocol\) is GREAT!  Just like we can build WWW/HTTP on top of TCP/IP  \-\-\&gt; But WWW/HTTP is not TCP/IP or vice\-versa.  

You can run WWW/HTTP over any reliable/stateful protocol.  Just like you can run Lightning/payment channels over any sufficiently adequate blockchain.

Assuming the above is correct and limited blocksize is not really one of the alternatives, would you count not having a limit at all as a candidate?

Nothing wrong with that, its exactly how banks are organized today. But its not decentralized - like advertised. Its very fragile, because you can target very few nodes to bring the entire network to a standstill. It should be anti-fragile. The ""attack"" you are asking for is a regulatory attack. If LN continues to be as centralized as this it will become exceedingly simply for government to single out hubs and slap regulation on them, eg KYC for everyone that transacts through them. Or that the hub requires a money transmitter license. This degree of centralization opens the entire network up to all sorts of shit that Bitcoin was specifically designed to be immune against.

A security is loosely defined by expecting a profit in the future for what you purchased. For example, you are expecting a profit by buying tokens in an ICO. That is different from Bitcoin, Monero, Nano which were INITIALLY not 'purchased' with the intent of appreciating but rather were mined or rewarded for a captcha.

This is relevant because when all the ICO coins (90+ tokens in the top 100) will become much harder to trade. Exchanges will require license to trade securities in the United States and it will be subjected to the same laws as the NYSE.

For exchanges outside of the United States, they will continue to trade these 'securities' but may have to restrict sale/withdrawal to US citizens (is my assumption).

Of course, new guidelines could be established especially for cryptocurrencies but it doesn't seem likely in the beginning.

The non-security coins like BTC, LTC, BCH, Monero, Nano and a few others will see a natural increase in volume and price due to being readily available.

Lastly, 2018-2019 will be the year of the crypto airdrop. If these strigent regulations come out for securities most ICOs, in the short term will choose to airdrop their tokens to avoid the security label. ",1526491728

"I am actively searching for alternatives to BitWage because of the treatment I received.

I used the service very successfully for about 6 months.

Each time I was paid my employer would send a portion of my check into the account they setup and BitWage would send Bitcoin to my wallet.

That worked fine and they never had any questions, although I did have to provide various identity documents.

That was no problem and I understood.

However, some of my compensation also comes in the form of commission invoices I send to customers for Agent commissions I earn on sales of products for my customers.

So I set\-up the invoicing feature and submitted invoices to BitWage each time I issued a commission invoice to my customers.

BIG MISTAKE.

From day one, my commission invoices were heavily questioned by BitWage and they treated me like a criminal.  They literally acted like I was some sort of money laundering international criminal and put me through no end of questioning, even going so far as to contact my CFO, requesting to be added to his Linked\-in  network, etc.

This is despite providing numerous documents, etc.

Then after the third such invoice they summarily cancelled my account and I was horribly treated during the process.

As near as I can figure, and this is only speculation, the amounts of my commission invoices scared them off.

I would have $8K, $21K invoices \- those types of amounts because I sell industrial equipment and even a 5&amp;#37; commission on a decent order can add up.

I think they could never wrap their heads around the fact that I wanted to receive these amounts in BTC since it was ancillary income and not required for day\-to\-day living.

I agree with those that say that this could be a huge issue for BCH in that miners may allow people to fill blocks for a very cheap rate. But that is what BCH has opted for - Huge blocks containing anything people are willing to pay to put into the blockchain.   
  
Blocks larger than are required the ONLY alternative I can see to a limited blocksize. If it doesn't work out - 1Mb blocks may be fine, and BTC will use L2 to scale - but we have the ability to try large blocks thanks to BCH. ",1526491247

"**Inflation**

In economics, inflation is a sustained increase in price level of goods and services in an economy over a period of time. When the price level rises, each unit of currency buys fewer goods and services; consequently, inflation reflects a reduction in the purchasing power per unit of money –  a loss of real value in the medium of exchange and unit of account within the economy. A chief measure of price inflation is the inflation rate, the annualized percentage change in a general price index, usually the consumer price index, over time. The opposite of inflation is deflation.

4. Project progress - How good is the wallet? How often does the team push updates/github activity, what is the roadmap?

Yes, but a property of the psychopath is that she lacks any meaning of being able to trust. Psychos in power will look at the government with *indifference*, to them it is just a tool, whereas we often look at governments with *disgust*.

The Pareto principle (also known as the 80/20 rule, the law of the vital few, or the principle of factor sparsity) states that, for many events, roughly 80% of the effects come from 20% of the causes. Management consultant Joseph M. Juran suggested the principle and named it after Italian economist Vilfredo Pareto, who noted the 80/20 connection while at the University of Lausanne in 1896, as published in his first paper, ""Cours d'économie politique"". Essentially, Pareto showed that approximately 80% of the land in Italy was owned by 20% of the population.

It is an axiom of business management that ""80% of sales come from 20% of clients"".

Fabric is a framework for creating distributed ledger solutions. It works with that file/data structure you're talking about and call blockchain.

On top of it they add a lot of other stuff that makes the whole system very very different from original Satoshi's proposal.

"Hello everyone. I'm writing this from my workdesk at a top investment firm that has been dabbling in crypto for several years, not officially ofc.

I recently started feeling guilty, my firm and a network of other large firms have decided we're gonna ""ice"" bitcoin and we've been been doing so for quite some time.

Basically this means we wont allow it to rise beyond a certain value, right now its 8600 and we've all agreed to never let it go above 10k again. Our agenda is to push it beneath 4k in order to accumulate massive volumes.

We're getting there and everything is going according to plan. 

I'm simply writing this out of guilt, you're all clueless as to whats happening in crypto and you're wondering how we efffectively muted the consensus-run.

If the firms found my real identity i'd be fired and probably worse.

My tip is to get out, you wont se any significant gains in a long, long time.

this means any new investors are going to have a lot harder time understanding the system, they can't just go and read the bitocin whitepaper like they can with BCH to understand it.

"&gt;Your BTC balance is not recorded on-chain. 

Correct, it is recorded on the LN - Each LN node will maintain the appropriate balance, with reference to the underlying funding tx.

&gt;In the event of a chain split, you are only getting what is recorded on the chain.

The txs funding the LN channels would still exist, and be valid, on both chains. LN wallets will always rely on full nodes to attest on the validity of the underlying tx, and if you upgrade the base layer nodes, the LN will not suffer.

&gt;So if you want to prepare for the fork, you need to close all your LN channels

You don't need that, explained above.

&gt;Another scenario is to prepare a hard fork where you don't have to close your channels so you are coordinating blockchain fork with a LN fork.

Not really... there is no ""hard fork of LN"". A LN wallet will always rely on base layer nodes to provide info on the state of the blockchain, as relevant. So if a full node is happy with the new chain, so will everything that relies on it.

&amp;nbsp;

But you are correct in saying that hard forks become more delicate to pull off, as all the higher layers will depend on it. Which disincentivises hard forks, and this is good. ""Immutable"" protocols inspire confidence and trust. TCP/IP did not change for the past ~30yrs, and won't change in the forseeable future, which allowed to build all sorts of stuff on top of it reliably, knowing that the base won't change. Similar story for Bitcoin - the base layer protocol should, at some point, become completely immutable. 

Luckily all the biggest upcoming changes can be soft-forked in: Schnorr, MAST and bulletrpoofs don't need a hard fork! (It's not ""luck"" really... it's what people worked hard to achieve.)

"Thank you for the links. You may be interested in Hashgraph...

So this is actually a semantics problem, and the term blockchain is being somewhat corrupted...in that what it meant and originally referrered to was the public chain of transactions held in the distributed ledger...it is a file that grows in size, and is shared p2p. In the hyperledger fabric they try to redefine blockchain as a a network of nodes, all running 'chaincode'.

If you want to call a network a blockchain, then fine, make private networks in enterprise environments, and call them whatever you want...""*private blockchains*"". I will just have to update my vocab.

To me, a blockchain is the data, that from the genesis, records the history of the network. It is the file that miners work on. It is a disruptive technology to the incumbent fiat fractional banking model, and the degree to which it has been corrupted in a decade is testament to the losing position humanity finds itself in. BTC, because of The Blockchain, solved a real world problem and thus accrued value. The hypetrain that it started is testament to it's ingenuity. Then came the 'scaling problem', power plays, politics, and more money than most people in this game had ever seen....and the rest is/will be perhaps if it is noteworthy in the end, history. Turing complete blockchains, BTC clones, forks, exchanges, tether, 'second layer solutions'....the hypetrain got a bit overheated and somepeople realised there was alot more problemsolving than problems....so we started talking about 'a store of value' because actually using the BTC or any token to transact for goods or services was too expensive (inflation wise or transaction wise), and slow.

I guess I just got burned out by the seemingly disgraceful handling of the situation by the few famous names that rose to the top. There are a small handfull of big winners, a group of success stories, and an ocean of bag holders and dreamers. If BTC incarnated as any token succeeds in breaking the grip of governmental issuance, then I'd be astonished at this point. We can all call networks of nodes running code 'blockchains' now, and pretend like it's the future.

Sorry for my rant, and I genuinely appreciate your links, and diplomatic stance!

Regulators and blockchain companies agree there is uncertainty. The question is how to oversee this brave new world.

How worried should investors be about regulatory interest in cryptocurrency and tokens? It depends.

Representatives of U.S. enforcement agencies stressed at the Consensus 2018 conference in New York they want to support digital innovation and emerging markets. However, they still want to monitor it.

The Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the Securities and Exchange Commission recognize that “cryptocurrencies can evolve and become something different than they are today,” said CFTC Commissioner Brian Quintenz.

“I’m encouraged that the concept of something evolving is being considered in this debate,” he said, arguing that “government regulatory policy should not hinder innovation [or] pick winners and losers [but] should be technology neutral.”

Still early though. With stuff like Robin hood slowly rolling out across the states, will be big if they allow withdraws. New p2p exchanges like payfair where you can trade directly with people in a number of alts. Wall Street bringing crypto markets.

Right now it is still somewhat difficult for those not good with tech to enter the market, it is slowly getting easier with more avenues though. Right now the basic way is to register on coinbase, go through the kyc, enter bank details, then wait like a week for your buy, if you then went alts not on cb then it is even more difficult.

"&gt;Early adopters took bigger risk

Yup, its definitely a bigger risk to spend 5 cents on mining 100 bitcoins in a few days on a desktop computer you already have than it is to spend $10,000 buying a rack of asics to mine 1 bitcoin a week.

It's simply a reward for innovative risk taking. 

The risks modern miners and speculators are taking are nothing compared to the risks the early pioneers took. What if Bitcoin never took off? Those 5 cents of electricity would be completely wasted, and they only stood to gain hundreds of millions of dollars.

These late comers have a much easier time. Not only do they have no chance of 100,000x their investment but they also stand to lose far more if Bitcoin goes to zero.",1526484418
"I don't think that's really so bad in this case. Banks already manage the security of people's money. The biggest benefit of crypto is the decentralized nature of creation, where you can't just print money willy\-nilly.

You can take care of your own security if you want, but many many people will not want that, and they shouldn't be excluded from the community. Plus, banks are businesses, and they all have an incentive to support the community and keep the ecosystem thriving. Banks are bad if they are the only option, but they aren't in the case of cryptocurrency. ",1526484415
"Please know all this about lightning before getting too excited 

Essentially, lightning only works as a scaling solution when everyone is already using it. It has no way to bridge the gap from no users(where it is starting) to everyone worldwide using it.

If the node you are trying to pay is offline, you simply can't pay. And you still incur fees when you settle your channels on the restricted blocksize chain.

Worse, it has numerous tradeoffs that will discourage the average person from using it. This amplifies the downsides that arise from it not being universally in use instantly, and will prevent it from ever reaching that state. Here are those:

1. You must be online all the time to be paid. And the person you want to pay must be online for you to pay them.

2. If you go offline at the wrong time and aren't using a centralized hub, you can lose money you didn't even knowingly transact with.

3. The solution to #2 is to enlist ""watchers"" to prevent you from losing money. More overhead the average person isn't going to care about or understand, and more fees that have to be paid. Or people will just be forced to use centralized hubs.

4. Two new users to Lightning will not be able to actually pay eachother without using a centralized hub because no one will lock up funds into the opposing side of their channels; No funded channels = can't pay eachother. Hence... Hubs.

5. Using hubs will come with monthly fee; They aren't going to lock up their capital on your behalf for no cost.

6. The entire system is vulnerable to a mass-default attack. Hubs are especially vulnerable.

7. Lightning will not be able to route large payments(no route available).

8. Lightning transactions are larger than normal transactions.

9. Lightning nodes must keep track of the full history of channel states themselves. If they lose this, they are vulnerable to attacks and may lose coins.

10. Attackers may randomly lock up funds anywhere along the chain of channels for extended periods of time(many hours) at no cost to themselves.

11. The network randomly may fail to work for a user under certain circumstances for no discernable reason as far as they can see (no route available). 


And the issues directly related to the not having everyone on the planet on lightning at first:

1. Small payments consolidating into larger ones, such as a retailer who needs to pay vendors, will fail to route on Lightning, and the loop between the source of the payments(end users) and their destinations(retailers) is broken. This means every channel will ""flow"" in one direction, and need to be refilled to resume actually being used.

2. Refilling every channel will be at least one onchain transaction, possibly two. If this happens twice a month, 1mb blocks + segwit will only be able to serve 4 million users. Some estimates are that Bitcoin already has 2-3 million users.

3. Regardless of lightning's offchain use, Bitcoin must still have enough transaction fees to provide for its network security. Except instead of that minimum fee level being shouldered by 1000 - 500000 million transactions, it is only shouldered by ~170 million transactions with segwit 1mb blocks.
That situation doesn't exist in a vacuum. Users will have a choice - They can go through all that, deal with all of those limitations, odd failures &amp; risks and pay the incredibly high fees for getting on lightning in the first place... Or they can just buy Ethereum, use a SPV wallet, and have payments confirmed in 15 seconds for a fraction of the fees. Or roughly the same choice for SPV+BCH.

The choice will be obvious.

My (and many others) opinion is that lighting is not near as good as people think it will be... It just isn't a scaling solution. Lightning is fine for use cases that need to do frequent, small, or predictable payments with few entities. For example, mining pools paying PPLNS miners. Or gamblers making small bets on gambling sites. Or traders making frequent trades on exchanges.

But as a general purpose scaling solution for average people? It sucks, and they are absolutely not going to go through all of that shit just to use crypto, especially not with better, cheaper, more reliable options out there.",1526484415
"They are very into formal verification of their code. Formal verification is a technique that is used for programs like NASA rovers, medical devices such as heart pacers, as well as military applications such as F-16 wing control module.

In particular, they are the first to have a formally verified proof-of-stake algorithm (ouroboros), and end of this month they are launching a smart contract capable testnet on their blockchain that will support writing formally verified smart contracts.",1526484407

"What I’m saying is it shouldn’t. Just because it happened doesn’t mean it should. It (link of btc to alts) catapults an already irrational market into frenzy constantly. 

Imagine being the mythical “institutional investor” putting money into anything other than btc? It would be suicidal. All it would take to lose his or her money is have a couple other institutional investors go bear mode on btc.

I’m not against btc, I’m saying it’s ludicrous to invest big money in the alt cryptospace when you’re at the mercy of one of THE MOST manipulatively unstable currencies ever created. 

We all may not like fiat and the way the fed prints money ect blah blah blah BUT it doesn’t continuously fuck the market because the USD is relatively stable. Btc will NEVER be stable. There needs to be a fiat to crypto that is universally accepted by major exchanges that is ACTUALLY pegged to usd. Once you have that you don’t need any other fiat pairings.

PROBLEM SOLVED.

Do this and then you’ll see who actually gives a fuck about btc. ",1526482930
"USD, like any FIAT, can most definitely decrease in value - obviously not at cryptocurrency levels though...

USD / fiat is the closest comparison you can make for Bitcoin. As, again, alts are measured in Satoshis... a value of Bitcoin. While completely different in valuations and price movements, BTC / FIAT currency is still a fair comparison to make... which is why Bitcoin is called a crypto**currency**.

"Yeah. There are essentially two filters to get through to understand BCH. The first is the ability to read and understand the whitepaper and the second is lack of susceptibility to the BS core narrative. If I had to guess, I think that a sizable proportion of people who get through Filter One also get through Filter Two. But there is some fraction of people who for whatever reason don't. 

I think it has something to do with a given person's degree of intuitive understanding of certain facets of economics as well as the person's general attitude toward governance problems.

Notice:

- The ancap subs and other ""liberty minded"" subs are dominated by people who see through the core bullshit.

- People with more authoritarian or socialist tendencies tend to lean toward Core (Mani Rosenfeld, Charlie Shrem, our friend, etc.)

- Roger Ver was one of the earliest to raise the black flag against core and Roger is also an ancap.

For whatever reason, those who are sympathetic with more collectivist ways of thinking were sucked in by the core narrative, with it's comforting but empty promises of ""consensus,"" ""safety,"" ""decentralization"" (which most of them use to actually mean democritization), etc. 

This same pattern also manifests in how the two subs /r/btc and /r/bitcoin moderate their content. Like /u/Anarcho_Capitalism, /r/btc is pretty much a free-for-all while theymos and company keep the core faithful on a tight leash.

"I think we have a huge chicken and egg situation in crypto right now.

* Prices are volatile because we have huge whales that control huge percentages of total supply
* Adoption is low because of price volatility and lack of businesses accepting crypto payments
* Businesses don't accept because volatility and 'not worth hassle' because of low adoption
* People are afraid of what they don't understand, and crypto is not the easiest thing to get into (and do it safely) for average Joe
* We need more and better wallet offerings for average Joes that aren't qualified to ""be their own bank"", possibly even centralized entities that they are willing to trust.
* Bitcoin itself is not usable as a currency on a global scale, it's just too damn slow (maybe as a store of value though?)
* No one knows yet what will be THE currency (or maybe a ""big 3"" or something) used for global commerce that is basically accepted anywhere

If we can solve some of these user-facing problems with slow progress, we still have the volatility.

If we have only around 1%-10% (US) population owning crypto at all (many of which are just small ""gambling money"" sums), and we know there are whales with huge wallets, we know volatility will continue. 

Thinking through this, if the price went up as more people started adopting, smart whales would start taking their money into more stable investments with intrinsic value like real estate. This would help distribute the ownership of crypto more evenly. Then, if we had more like 50% of the population with 50% of their capital in crypto, the ownership would be much more spread out, decreasing volatility.

Not sure how we get there though. I think it just takes time.",1526482690

Is it possible that we have reached a point where all the weak hands have been shaken out and only hodlers, bears, and people timing the market are left?

Thus this creates a situation where a single whale can pump the market and then dump once others pile on some time later for profit? I think this would explain all the ""Barts.""

"&gt; Yes but nearly all of those tx have a fee of under 1sat/byte that won't propagate to many nodes and a merchant would notice that.

That's not true... txs propagate so long as they are valid, AFAIK there's nothing putting a floor on BCH txs. Nodes will see those txs, and so will your merchant. 

A tx is either valid or invalid. If it's valid, it will be propagated by all nodes. And those are all valid txs.

Nope, I want fees to go up as soon as possible. People will be using the LN, which will only strengthen the BTC economy.

Unfortunately, to the mainstream right now, crypto is BTC.  It’s going to be hard to sell BTC to them after the collapse of the bubble at the beginning of the year.  I feel like BTC is going to continue on this bear run and fall precipitously down in value to a fraction of what it has been.

Even darknet markets are going to have to get away from BTC as law enforcement becomes better at tracing transactions through the BTC blockchain.  It’s not “the new gold” or much of “a store of value” for industrialized countries when it can easily drop 10%+ in a day.  The whales keep dumping but we don’t know if they’re planning to buy back.

I also don’t know if we’ll see cryptos valued at $1000+ ever again.  It’s just not practical to expect the processes these coins and tokens are supposed to facilitate to cost hundreds of thousands of dollars or even millions to execute.  I think the peak for most top 25 coins will be under $10 each with a few rare ones creeping up to $100.  You’re not going to see people turn $100 into $1,000,000 in a year or two by just HODLing a single purchase in a wallet.  That’ll drive out a lot of the moonboys.",1526481467

"The Neutrino protocol actually [requires you to download full blocks](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/8h7bo1/carol_must_study_game_theory_to_pay_her_bills/dyhs5id/?context=3). The reason they give is privacy.

&gt; Lightning uses a gossip protocol to discover the current state of the network and this does not require usage of a hub-spoke topology. See Bolt #7.

I was assuming that a mobile device would not be able to handle the gossip protocol with any real usage. To use your own coffee example: 10,000,000 people are changing the state of channels in the network every day just for coffee. That is 115 state changes per second. A channel update message is  128 bytes. That means each node must download around 15kB/s (instead of 15kB every 10 minuites) continuously while trying to pay for coffee.

&gt;&gt; When it comes time to spend, your recipient needs to be online to sign time-locked transactions.
&gt; I believe there are solutions for this in the works, such as through the use of trustless third-party watchers.

That involves pre-signing any messages you expect to need. Your watcher can still broadcast the wrong transaction: costing you money.

that paper does not adress the glaring problem of what is a blockchain without a valued token linked to it...

you have not grasped the issue. you don't understand why blockchains are secure. it is not because they use cryptography, that just makes them fairly annonymous, and allows for third party 'mining'. blockchains are secure because they incentivise miners to do the work of mining, by offering 'compensation' in the form of a reward denominated in that blockchain's token.

no token means, no miners, means, no blockchains. you can have a 'blockchain-ish' distributed encrypted database...but it is not truly decentralised, and it is thus not a blockchain.

you cannot seperate the crypto token from the blockchain technology by definition.

No. Absolutely not.  LN fees are 1-2 satoshi, period. **NOT** 1-2sat/b.

"&gt; Pushing the load off-chain does not reduce the hardware requirements.

Lets look at an example:

**Scenario 1: 10,000,000 users each purchasing a single cup of coffee once per day for 1 year.**

10,000,000 * 365 = 3,650,000,000

So that is 3,650,000,000 transactions that need to be replicated across every single full node, stored for eternity, and validated each time a new node joins the network.

**Scenario 2: 1,000,000 users each purchasing a cup of coffee once per day for 1 year via lightning network**

For the purposes of this example, lets keep things simple and assume these were all purchased over a single channel - so 1 opening and 1 closing transaction for each user (of course in real life there are an infinite number of permutations of channel configs to facilitate these payments).

10,000,000 * 2 = 20,000,000

This is 3.65 billion transactions to store on-chain, vs 20 million in the lightning model for the same net effect (3.65 billion coffee purchases) - a considerable difference.

&gt; In fact, the lighting network appear to increase the hardware requirements for mobile users.
&gt; 
&gt; With SPV, you download about 12kB per block (headers), plus whatever transactions you are interested in.

A mobile lightning wallet would most likely implement a Bitcoin Light Client such as Neutrino. The requirements for this are pretty low - comparable to SPV I believe.

&gt; When you want to make a payment: you don't need to worry about routing. Just broadcast (unicast to several nodes?) the transaction. The recipient does not need top be online: they only need access to their private keys in order to spend.
&gt;
&gt; The lightning network, on other other hand, requires you to know the real-time state of the network. The only way around it is to use a hub-and spoke model: which require trust on the part of the user.

Lightning uses a gossip protocol to discover the current state of the network and this does not require usage of a hub-spoke topology. See [Bolt #7](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lightning-rfc/blob/master/07-routing-gossip.md).

&gt; When it comes time to spend, your recipient needs to be online to sign time-locked transactions.

I believe there are solutions for this in the works, such as through the use of trustless third-party watchers.

&gt; You also need to trust a ""watchtower"" service because: backing up state in case your node is destroyed can led to the loss of funds.

Watchtowers are still under active development and I don't think it is currently known quite how they fit into the network topology or what the trust model will be. So I think you are jumping to conclusions by stating this as a fact. It ls likely that there will be many different forms of watchtowers operating under many different models to suit different users needs. Some may be free services, others may be paid services. Some may be centralized, others may be decentralized and require very little or no trust.

&gt; You still need to back-up your private keys, obviously.

So, no difference here.

So unless I'm missing something, your statement about the hardware requirements doesn't seem to hold true. And your multiple statements about the lightning network and how it does or doesn't work are incorrect or based on incorrect assumptions. There is absolutely no need to burden all of the network's full nodes with billions upon billions of irrelevant records about every single user's past, present, and future coffee purchases.",1526479239

"&gt; With a proof of stake coin, the production of new coins doesn't consume resources, so the amount of money that leaches from the system is inevitably lower. If Bitcoin is meant as a store of value, it will always be at a disadvantage compared to a coin that gives you interest every year.

The economics of cryptocurrencies is not purely a profit making business for miners or large stakeholders. PoS is open to manipulation by collusion of large stakeholders, and it also just serves to make the rich get richer for doing nothing, much like the traditional banking system.

&gt; Imagine if gold was stolen and lost at such a high rate. We would consider it a terrible store of value.

Look up how much gold the US government stole from people in 1934, by threat of physical violence (imprisonment) for anyone who didn't comply.

Bitcoin has been lost so far due to poor security practices by regular users (who weren't using hardware wallets) and incompetent software developers. A large part of these have been weeded out now that people are building proper businesses and are hiring competent professionals.

There is still big risks if large amounts of the network activity are centered on particular platforms, because they then become primary targets, and pose a risk to many more customers. As more businesses pop up and diversify the network, the risks of this decrease.

The ability for Bitcoin to survive after MtGox was hacked and a significant portion of the total coinage was stolen shows that the network is resilient even against coin theft. Ultimately, you're responsible for securing your own funds, and if you give custody of them to someone else, you'd better do your homework and make sure they're competent.

&gt; Bitcoin is too volatile to serve as a store of value.

Storing value does not mean you need to look at the day to day fluctuations in trading price. Imagine you done this for a 20-year bond, despite your funds being locked away for the next 20 years. The reason people don't think this way in Bitcoin is because their funds are not locked away, they can spend them at any time of day on any day of the year.

The price of bitcoin is going to go up if demand continues to grow, because the supply rate is rapidly declining. At peak demand, if we ever get there, the gains people can make will decline and the currency will likely be much less volatile. However, at this point, you will not be measuring Bitcoin in terms of USD, but you'll be measuring USD in terms of Bitcoin, and 1 Bitcoin will always have the value of 1 Bitcoin, because there is no single party who can deflate its value.

&gt; Of course not. Fees to use the system need to be low. And if fees are low, then you have no reason to use the lightning network.

$0.01 fee is not low when talking about ""microtransactions"". Microtransactions can and will be sub-cent amounts of money. In a microtransaction economy, people will be making tens of transactions per minute, in tiny fractions of cents, for each bit of content their web browser downloads on the web. In that case, a 1 cent fee is gigantic.

At some point, miners are going to need to factor in bandwidth and storage costs for propagating everyone's microtransactions and having a massively redundant global storage system for them is going to cost more than the microtransactions are even worth in the first place. Big blocks are definitely not a solution to microtransactions. Buying a coffee or downloading a song is a macrotransaction.

&gt; Increasing freedom

There's the privacy issue, which is probably the biggest cause of concern left with cryptocurrency. With off-chain solutions it is not possible for a third-party to see what is being transacted and to whom. They can only see that you open up a channel and when you close it. With regular P2SH and P2PKH transactions, everyone can see when you're trading and who with, and there's a very high probablity that they will be able to link this back to your identity, unless you go out of your way to using some mixing service, which is not provided by default. Ideally we want even better privacy, like Monero has built in, and preferably at no extra cost.

But you are right. I didn't move back. Most people who buy into the BCH game have to be too far off by this point anyhow

Oh: I am sure there are people who genuinely believe in BCH as the solution to something. I too see that it can function as a cheap and fast payment alt. Problem is, I'm not going to support an ecosystem that are so hellbent of destruction, so if I needed that, I'd pick a different altcoin.

"Thank you for bringing up this point in a reasonable way. Sorry someone else is calling you a “fucking retard”. I think anyone with decentralization as a priority is good in my book, even if I disagree with you.

From what I understand, huge block sizes are capable on current and reasonably cheap hardware. Here’s a video with a testnet of 1GB blocks. https://youtu.be/5SJm2ep3X_M

It’s cool to see that developers are doing their best to test huge blocks instead of just arguing that they won’t work. Something interesting that came out of this video is that the Bitcoin software was the bottleneck, which can be improved with parallelism.

Running a node with such large blocks would either require a lot of disk space (Moore’s law might handle this aspect of it) or some pruning on the node. I’m still learning about this, but could we say an argument against large block sizes is that the blocks could get so big that the average PC couldn’t hold every block, leaving data centers to hold the blockchain - thus decentralizing?

A good thing I’ve heard multiple times from the BCH side is that they will implement layer 2 solutions when they are ready. AKA, keep the money flowing while later 2 solutions are being worked on.",1526472612

"I do not want to claim anything, I have a working brain that understands how these systems work and what they produce, and it occurred to me that Bitcoin's PoW mining system actually uses communist type system... and if you think about it, pay attention to what BCH community is doing about block size, the original idea of Satoshi was to always increase block size so to always have enough capacity for everyone, and for the fees to be cheap so that using Bitcoin was available for everyone, that is in itself also a communist mentality because unlike RBF which forced people to fight/compete for block space, the original Bitcoin and now BCH community do not like that idea, am I correct or not?

Think about it... Capitalist mentality is to never have more supply then demand, as that brings their prices down.

Look at diamonds as another example, there are plenty of diamonds, they are not so hard to find, but the diamond capitalists (which there are only few families that have monopoly on all of mining of diamonds) artificially limit the number of diamonds to the market, so to keep the price up by making artifical scarcity.

Bitcoin Core have done exact same thing... they limited the BTC block size and added RBF, exactly what a capitalist who wants to have a monopoly would do, and what they actually do.

So you can all attack me all day long, I know when I am right, and I am right about this, Satoshi has somewhat communist mentality, and he doesn't even know it, and also the ecosystem of BCH does the same, without them even knowing it.

Maybe they all think they have to keep the block size always large enough so that everyone can use it, otherwise they think no one will use it, that is another possibility which doesn't strike me as proper communist mentality, so maybe I am wrong about their intentions and why they are doing things the way they do (what their motive is) but the end result is still non capitalist mentality.

maybe... just maybe... Satoshi and the people that want to run its system, have in mind that once they have everyone using it, that then and only then, they would start exploiting their power and start charging users more, and if that was to happen, I will have changed my mind about them.... but till that happens I have to stick to my current way of thinking.",1526470387

95% from all the altcoins are scam. Better not invest.
Before BCH, the major coins lived side by side, and the devs explained the pro and contra from every major coin. Every major  coin, Bitcoin, ETH, LiteCoin, Monero, Dash, Zcash, have the pros and contras. And when you was new at crypto, it was easy to choose what you liked and who you trusted.

This is pure speculation. If the value of BCH rose a lot the minimum fee could be reduced from 1 sat/byte to 0.1 sats per byte and this idea has already been discussed, including advocated by Roger Ver.

You can't draw a deliberately manipulative graph now because of what you think might happen in the future.

If the fees on BCH chain do indeed rise above BTC fees in the future then a graph with both values shown on the same scale will clearly show this without needing to manipulate anything.

"I'm sorry, but this isn't fair.

fork.lol is useful because it also measures fees in sats/B. Other sites use USD, which is then influenced by the respective fiat values of BTC and BCH. 

The sat/B comparison between the two is not using a different scale, as the post being linked to claims, because they both have the same number of satoshi. 

To show why this is important, consider if BCH had a massive increase in USD price, and matched BTC dollar for dollar. 

At the same sat/B fee performance, BCH fees would then **be equivalent to the expensive BTC chain**, and one of our key selling points (cheap fees) would be nullified. Improving our sat/B performance is critical, to keep low fees a thing when the USD value starts to increase. Measuring sats/B is therefore more important than USD/B.

In other words, measuring fees in USD gives BCH a massive advantage today, but that isn't the case if the chain becomes more valuable. It's therefore important to measure in sats/B, and NOT USD.

There's a separate argument here about measuring average versus median fees, because the average fee is blatantly being gamed at the moment. It only takes a few crazy fees to raise the whole average. This is the only change I'd like to see on fork.lol (to use median, not average). 

The sat/B comparison is a fair one though. ",1526469071
"&gt;it will take decades to get anywhere close to 32M

"While I agree that there are certain economic forces ar play, if one can use the ASIC to offset a pure cost, like that of a standard water heater, it really helps with the ROI period. I want to say my break-even on modern bitcoin ASICs is around 18 months and Litecoin ASICs around 12 months. This is based on electricity use measured at the wall with meters and daily wallet payouts over many months.

By offsetting my apartment heater with the hot air from my mining operation all winter I managed to save an additional $80/mo on top of the margins I was seeing for the ASICs alone. I really enjoyed having a free hot tub to lounge in whenever I wanted for a week, as I used it about twice a day instead of my usual shower, and that benefit has a monetary value as well... If I were to use this setup to completely replace my water heater it would shave off whatever electricity use my showers and dishwasher / clothes washer consume.

I hope this helps illustrate how the benefits of cost-saving, when coupled with the coin output on even severely outdated boxes, is still financially more efficient than simply burning electricity through a resistive coil.",1526468749

Cryptocurrency was created for the sole purpose of bypassing and exiting the existing government and financial institutions.  If the state was good at its job, Bitcoin wouldn't have been necessary because the dollar was so useful.  The whole purpose of Bitcoin is to be able to resist state-level actors because we expect the state to overreach and be bad at its job.  If there were trustworthy institutions that worked well, we wouldn't need a new system designed to remove the necessity of trust.  The things that crypto enables are specifically the things that weren't possible before solely because we could not rely on any individuals or institutions to be trustworthy.  So when the state comes in and says ""yeah crypto is great, but it just needs some of my oversight and regulation"", they're just missing the point entirely.

"For me, economics is the study of managing the world's limited resources.  This is considered at a macro and micro level. It covers the production, distribution and consumption of products and services.  Your focus was on the money side of economics, so my critique would be that your should be clearer which part of economics you are debunking.  

Another point I'd take issue with is the idea that money is like energy and can't be created.  I would argue that money represents value and value can be created (from nothing), unlike energy.  Also, what about credit? That's creating money.  To be clear, I'm not a fan of QE.

I had a few more points I'd debate but I watched it last night and don't remember off hand.  I'm not saying I didn't agree with anything you said, I did agree with much of it, particularly the points around decentralisaion.  

If you're keen for more feedback I'll watch it again and get some notes.  As you may have gathered crypto economics is an area of interest for me and I'm keen to think about new ideas/ approaches to it - so certainly not dismissing your ideas.  I'm particularly interested / concerned in crypto monetary policy and can't decide whether a deflationary currency is the right approach (in summary because I think it drives speculation leading to volatility and hence being a hindrance to adoption).",1526464810

The problem is that the government is dominated by outdated old farts, that are simply put, unable to understand the simplest of technological developments and the magnitude of their importance to society today.

"You're right but that doesn't make me wrong either. I won't talk about your point, because I already agree.

But I think you misunderstood my point. As I said, this has nothing to do with Blockstream's intention and I'm not saying Blockstream is intentionally doing this. I'm just talking about incentive structure. 

1. Blockstream's business plan is to make money off-chain. That's the business plan they raised VC money with. (As you see in OP's screenshot)
2. If Bitcoin can scale without off-chain solutions, then Blockstream's business plan suddenly doesn't work.
3. Therefore, Blockstream has more incentive to move transactions off chain.

Again, I am NOT saying this is what Blockstream is doing. I'm simply pointing out the facts and the observations on the incentive structure. To understand this better, ask yourself the opposite: ""Would Blockstream benefit if they could spend all their money coming up with an on-chain scaling solution, when everything happens on-chain is out of their control?""",1526463042

Be patient. All in due time. The tech is there. The companies and partnerships are coming in. Don't expect to get rich like people who got in 8 years ago in just a few months. It will take time but it's a given that Blockchain and DLT are here to stay and progressing at a very rapid rate. Most of us are putting in money and just waiting to get rich. Can't be mad that it's taking a little too long lol. I actually feel like this is just a period of big money taking time and strategizing how they will use the crypto space. Wall street guys and large corporations don't just their money around. They are planning and strategizing. Too many big names coming in for crypto to fail. Not sure which coins will be the winners in the long run but we are past the days of 100 percent faith in the dollar and big banks. Strong hands will look back and be grateful they held on. And what has been happening lately is much more realistic and sustainable than December 2017. I want my gains to stay not come and go.

I'm seeing [this](https://explorer.bitcoin.com/bch/tx/6ece5071255b82dbf132fc2761e881c8bf38be112e584407a9eaf4202208a0c4)\(hash1?\) and [this](https://explorer.bitcoin.com/bch/tx/48265e511a878710e3ccefa8ab3e6099dd8bcc1bf2da88b67e286c46971ebc6c) transactions for $1.23.

&gt; The puzzle is solved with the string ""BCH is the best Bitcoin"". The  script is \&lt;String1\&gt; \&lt;String2\&gt; OP\_XOR OP\_HASH256  \&lt;hash1\&gt; OP\_EQUAL. It's solved by finding the secret String1 that  when XORed with String2, after hashing should be equal to hash1. 

What are we supposed to do? Is ""BCH is the best Bitcoin"" \&lt;String2\&gt;? When we find find \&lt;String1\&gt; do we make a transaction with the script above? What happens if \&lt;string1\&gt; is correct/incorrect? If it takes \~10 minutes for all the miners to compute a hash with 18 preset characters, how am I supposed to find a nonce for an exact hash, isn't that equal to breaking SHA256?

I immediately starting buying every three weeks or so after the Feb 5th dump. I have only put in a small amount this time because I feel deep down we know a big dump is coming. 

I really hope there are still some moon shots out there but I have a theory. Crypto went really mainstream in Dec and that usually means it's too late. Will we really see 100k BTC 10 years from now? 

People slag on Charlie Lee but I think he warned us about what was about to happen. The guy sold ATH and called a multi year bear market and 20$ LTC. Shilling works on Reddit and the fanboy coin clan comments are creepy as fuck.

In the end there will be one cryptocurrency that rules them all. I honestly think it will be BTC 120 years from now when the last BTC is mined and AI controls us all and the Apocalypse is unfolding for our grandchildren children.

That doesn't mean I can't get rich off what really is the beggining of the end. So getting back to Charlie Lee. 20$ LTC is the signal for the end of the bear market. That might be a month away or three years away. 

That's my Catholic upbringing and I do believe this probably is what's going to happen. Logical me is trying to make cash off this crazy crypto in this moment. You look around the subreddits and it's crazy.

But the reward per block halves about every 4 years. It’a 12.5 BTC now so after the next halving it will be 6.25 BTC. That does make the rate at which bitcoins are created go down.

"|\*| Some late night shower thoughts if you will as to the current state of crypto.....

* The rise of Bitmex is one of the reasons why BTC has become this volatile.  BTC has never been this volatile ever.  It is being shorted and longed on every single piece of new information no matter what.  The degenerate gamblers of Bitmex have turned BTC into an altcoin.   What I mean is that with the leverage these gamblers are addicted to and combined with the FUD and twitter TA traps, whales on Bitmex and other exchanges have turned BTC into a high capped volatile altcoin.  You may be thinking, ""well how can btc be treated like an altcoin by these ppl when even on its worse day it only moves 15&amp;#37; in either direction....."".  Answer: Bitmex leverage.  Those 5\-10&amp;#37; swings at 100x are massive.  And this is happening over and over and over and over.  And will continue to happen unless the flood gates of BTC are opened or permanently closed.    Bitmex may have been around 1 year ago \(not sure\) but it's never had this big of a market impact.  Will not shock me if another 2 Bitmex clones come out later this year with better liquidation rates.  

* The sophistication and the further development of trading bots have ruined altcoins as a result of the above Bitmex BTC manipulating idiots.    The bots we have today are different than 1 year ago and will only get better, cheaper and more idiot friendly in the future.   These bots are reacting not only to BTC price movements from the Bitmex idiots but they are also using twitter scraping keywords such as ""partnership, listing, airdrop, etc..."" and are pumping coins milliseconds after any announcements, and inflating the prices of any of the alts with news.   The news scrapers, I don't mind much but the BTC swing bots are destroying alts.   Think about it.  Right now the only alts that are doing the type of gains we saw in 2017 are on new exchanges \(hadax, etc\) and/or ETH based exchanges \(Idex, etc\).  Both of those types of exchanges don't have anywhere near the level of moronic bots that Binance has.  In fact with Binance's low fees, it easily has the most bots of any exchange I can think of \(not sure about the strictly Asian ones\), since these cheap ass bot owners want to spend as little on fees on the hundreds of transactions their bots take part in every day.  Simply put if your altcoin is strictly on Binance you are royally fucked.  This was evident for anyone that held WTC/VEN/ICX when Binance was the lone exchange at hand \(although whale suppression was also a reason for some of those coins as well.....\).

Moving forward, not sure what to do, started in May 2017, still way, way up, already cashed out my initial 10 fold and still have a good chunk in alts.  But Im thinking about just staying in BTC now and playing days like today, catching the bottom of the alts I like and either flipping on the upcoming recovery days or hodling and DCA'ing only on days like today \(these types of days will prolly be common moving forward\).

I'm thinking maybe if Bitcoin ETFs get announced that will be a big enough catalyst to stop the Bitmex mafia from capitalising on BTC volatility and will clean the bears right out........truth be told no clue about what is true or not......these are just musings late night after a long hard shower......",1526456123

I think only time will tell. If the US regulates Crypto positively, then they have to fix that issue or all utility tokens will end up being pretty much non\-compliant. If they end up trying to strangle it, then all utility tokens are gonna have a rough time.

Third, SHA256 allows you to mine with whatever piece, it is just like you won't turn out any profit with a CPU or a GPU due to the overwhelming hash power the network has. It is the same for buying a single ASIC.

You're stuck in a line of thinking that some chinese capitalist is evil and is throwing everything you can to sustain your position. It is chinese, so it is shit. Silicon Valley is in the US, so just produce better tech and start to sell, this is liberal capitalism.

GPU production is centralized in two global manufacturers.

ASICs are efficient, dedicated circuits, that tend to be cheaper and cheaper over time like all the rest of electronic components, but even faster because they are much simpler circuits. The simpler they are, the better. 

Common sense will tell you that you want the best Hashrate/electricity cost ratio possible. Anything else is just politics and crap.

What happens if you relaunch bitcoin with a different algo, say, Sha512? CPU farms will turn into GPU farms that will turn into ASIC farms. There is no way around it. In any liberal capitalist economy the guy putting more money sooner than others have an edge.

"&gt; The DAA is meant to be transparent, it is meant to have no economical effect, saying that it is the most significant difference between BCH and BTC is just wierd to me.

I did not say DAA is the most significant difference between BCH and BTC. I said it is the intentional use of consensus formed by a minority work capacity. The _change_ was significant, specifically _the reason for the change_. The DAA itself is only an _artifact_ of that change.",1526455268

"&gt;&amp;gt; what are the most signicant diference between BTC and BCH in your opinion.

&gt;The most significant difference between them is BCH's intentional use of a consensus formed by a minority work capacity. The difference in DAA is not particularly significant from a technology perspective - had BCH's (new) DAA been the original bitcoin difficult schedule it would be unremarkable. _The act of making the change_ is *very* significant, as it was done with the intent of protecting a minority fork.

That I don’t understand.

The DAA is meant to be transparent, it is meant to have no economical effect, saying that it is the most significant difference between BCH and BTC is just wierd to me.

If you have someone that have no idea what cryptocurrencies is, would you explain the difference between the two by saying:

BTC calculate its difficulty every 2000 blocks using a 2000 blocks window and BCH calculate its difficulty using an 100 blocks window and recalculate difficulty for each blocks.

Surely those are not defining feature, are they?",1526454997

oh and the fact that you have to pay bots to upvote your content if you want it to get any exposure at all

"I can think of many reasons but here are a few:

1. Because it's free to upgrade and has no disadvantages
2. It future-proofs things to do so now -- encouraging growth. One of the risks associated with using BTC now is the fact that its capacity is limited.  Having a huge block size limit ensures this risk doesn't exist for companies/people investing in BCH infrastructure.
3. It also opens up new app and use possibilities especially since this upgrade also introduces new opcodes.

Basically, there's nothing like room to expand to promote expansion.  New apps are possible now that we added more op-codes and a 220 byte OP_RETURN code (which is used to embed data into the blockchain for things like the Memo blockchain-based facebook replacement).

If some killer apps take off we'll be glad we're on 32MB right now, rather than scrambling at the last minute to raise the limit.
 
Also psychologically for everyone that supported the coin -- we were all so traumatized by core's insistence on a very low block limit that we are enjoying our newfound freedom to raise the limit as has been the plan all along before BTC was subverted by bad actors.
