"Bitcoin is good for what it is. A form of decentralized currency, and it has a very strong brand that is globally recognized.

However, Ethereum is worth more, because it's not just a currency but a platform for creating decentralized projects, including but not limited to raising funds through ICOs.

It's use value is immense, and quite difficult to grasp. Just the sheer scale of projects and launched ICOs that currently exist.

It's MUCH more valuable than Bitcoin (without taking anything away from bitcoin).

The price just hasn't caught up to value yet. As the general public becomes aware of this idea, it's going to lead to an immense price increase. ETH is EXTREMELY undervalued. I think that the masses just don't understand this yet.

Just the idea that anyone (who can program in solidity) can program an agreement(contract), send it into the ETH blockchain and then have the contract distribute funds as real word events trigger things, it's pretty crazy.

Full Disclosure: I'm invested in ETH and am interested in programming in Solidity.",1524293878

"There's a vast difference between burning 12% of _fees_ per block, which is a negligible reduction in overall supply -- not to mention these mined fees may not have gone into the market anyway as not all miners immediately sell coins, and ""significantly"" increasing inflation or supply of the coin.

BCH already has less coins _available_ than BTC, but it's not easily visible by any market size metric unless you look at coins that have only moved since the fork which also introduces a large margin of error.

Unless some wants to burn thousands of coins, it'll have no effect on the market. Adding thousands of coins also would have limited effect on the market.

He is quoted in your source:

&gt; But the main point is that I don't claim any special expertise in technology -- I almost never make technological forecasts, and the only reason there was stuff like that in the 98 piece was because the assignment required that I do that sort of thing. The issues about Bitcoin, however, are not technological! Everyone agrees that it's technically very sweet. But does it work as money? That's a very different kind of question.

I disagree very fundamentally with this.  He fails to understand that its economic aspects are predicated on its technology.  It's not like a business that happens to produce technology (which can fail due to any number of non technical reasons such as bad marketing, regulation, and so on).  Bitcoin is instead 100% from-the-ground-up built as a way to store and transfer value in a trustless and decentralised manner.

"**SegWit2x**

Segwit2x was a proposed upgrade to hard fork the cryptocurrency Bitcoin. The proposal consisted of two separate parts: Activate Segregated Witness in August 2017 and then trigger a hard fork for a 2 megabyte block size. After the activation of SegWit in August as part of the proposal, the next step in the process was to hard fork to increase the block size; the fork was estimated to occur on 16th November 2017.

"Because even without a blocksize limit, the miner still needs incentive to include the transactions in a block.  This is because not only does the miner have to pay for hard drive space, but also because time it takes them to include all that data into the block, and every second is important because all the other miners are trying to solve for the same block reward.  Otherwise the miners would just mine empty blocks because it's easier.  

&gt;Why would miners continue to mine once the block reward . . .
Your second question answers itself because at that point (over 100 years from now),  mining revenue would based solely off of transaction fees.

It doesn't matter how big the blocksize limit is.   1mb looked like it would take a long time before we even get close in the early days of bitcoin.  One day, the amount of transactions will hit (or get close to) the hard limit.

"&gt; ""enforcing the blocks"" only matters if anybody cares if you reject a block and effectively leave the network - which they won't unless you're in a position to make them.

Miners care if their fork they mine is not being bought or traded by end users.  Exchanges care if they end up on a different fork than the majority of their customers.  If miners and exchanges make their own fork, but if the majority of end users dont follow them, it goes no where. Take away the nodes from end users, and nothing prevents those companies from changing the rules.

&gt;For example:

But its the opposite! The problem is not that ordinary users can not change the rules; of course they cant. Bitcoin was designed to resist protocol changes, and to date, there has not been a single backwards incompatible consensus change, ie hardfork. The point its that ordinary users can ensure they are **not changed**. If only miners and exchanges run full nodes, then they CAN change the consensus rules, giving them complete control.

&gt;centralize overwhelmingly in the hands of the developers 

Thats such nonsense! Bitcoin developers have zero ability to change the consensus rules. None, nada. Which is nicely illustrated by the fact the consensus rules have not changed once since the genesis block. New rules and protocols and protocol layers have been added, but they are all opt-in. You're not forced to use segwit. You dont have to use LN. You can still use bitcoin using the exact same consensus rules from Satoshi's first client.

"&gt;Literally none of the value of burned coins is lost. 100% of that value is given back to the community.

Here you prove you don't understand how money works. Money is worthless without a community. And bitcoin cash's community right now is 1% of what it could be. Therefore the best way to help the bitcoin cash community is by growing it. If you have a chance to grow this community but flush it down the toilet saying ""I helped the community"" and anyone who disagrees with you ""doesn't understand how money works"" then you are economically illiterate. 

&gt;Very well, because people have a right to do what they want with their own money, and provably burning money that has a guaranteed controlled supply, which redistributes the value of the burned coins back to the entire community, is in no way damaging to anyone.

Burning your money doesn't have a guaranteed supply because that money you are burning has already been taken into account by the market, someone paid you using that money. You didn't print it from a central bank printer. You are damaging the person who paid you to start with, then don't charge him to start with. And if you have to then give back to him by throwing it back in the market. But by burning it, when you can spend it and give someone a meal or help someone start a business, you are damaging that person. it is called opportunity cost. 

&gt;Not a single person is deprived of anything other than the person doing the burning.

yes 10 children in africa who can live on $1 a day are dead because you burned $10 per day to help ""hodlers"".

And I showed you that BCH got much more node per market cap..

And Core dev is so centralised it is literally akin to central planning.

Bitcoin consensus is achieved via silencing and threatening any opposite view or business until what solutions they want get implemented. (And bait the miner to get segwit.. remember B2x)

&gt;Core doesn't control anything; 

It is not core alone, but the with the help of forum censorship and social attacks.

&gt;the ecosystem cumulatively does. 

No, free speech wasn’t allowed.

Do you deny that?

And they got rid of anyone that didn’t follow the official line.

No. There is actually a fee of 0.5 XCP for the creation of ""named"" tokens, which have a label. But it's free to create ones without one.

Tokens like XCP (or Omni in this regard) were sort of the binding glue between BTC and the other tokens.

it never mentions the strain and capabilities of the blockchains scale in response to this continuous exchange of information?

"As someone who was around Bitcoin before Coinbase existed, there were many fears about what it meant to have a corporation that has so many ties to existing regulatory and banking systems. Would they be supporters of the decentralized vision? Or would they quickly succumb to the type of control typical of most centralized entities either by forced compliance or by greed?

It didn't take long to know the answer to that.

First, was their inclusion of a phishing scheme called BCash as if it was legitimate. They either didn't do their homework and were ignorant, or had business ties to it. Either way, it was a clear sign they were failing.

Second, was their lackluster attempt at protecting the privacy of their users. They are now happy to report users to the IRS, both via the summons and via proactive actions of reporting trades as if they were a typical brokerage. Rather than side with customers, and prefer to shut down and burn their data, they preferred to sell out their customers in order to survive. It may have been the correct business move, but the incorrect moral move.

And Bitcoin, without the principles, is worthless. Coinbase has proven to only be about making a buck, and has no respect or loyalty to it's customers or to the purpose of Bitcoin's entire point of existing.

Coinbase was initially a good on-ramp for dollar to bitcoin conversion, but now, it is probably doing more harm than good. Even if Coinbase has accelerated the price of Bitcoin by making it easier for people to ""invest"", at what cost?

If we lose what Bitcoin is, we might as well be PayPal. And that is not what I signed up for.",1524288663

"It's more an acknowledgement of reality as it currently stands since  ""enforcing the blocks"" only matters if anybody cares if you reject a block and effectively leave the network - which they won't unless you're in a position to make them. 

For example: if you and a large number of mates were to add a rule to your full node that rejected any block with a transaction count that's a multiple of 13 (call it the unlucky BIP) and you all rejected the next block since it contained 260 transactions. Since all of the miners are on the next block all of your nodes will be waiting for a block that never comes, and since the miners and nodes that aren't enforcing that rule have a higher block height, the rest of the network will move on with nary a stutter. Now replace that silly ""unlucky BIP"" with any rule or act of ""enforcement"" carried out by non-mining full nodes and you'll get the exact same result - the rest of the network moves on without them.

Last years Segwit2x debacle wasn't as a result of UASF but a social media blitz coupled with several exchanges (significant actors) and BitFury (miners) rejecting it. UASF was a PR exercise - nothing more (hence the hats and the hashtags). Actually the Segwit2X event was an excellent example of how that relatively small group of actors is anything but monolilthic - they all have their own opinions and interests that they defend with the power that they wield, which is why it's not at all the equivalent of Ripple signing transaction blocks. 

In all honesty I like this system better because if non-mining full nodes really did matter then as adoption increased power would centralize overwhelmingly in the hands of the developers controlling the core branch of the bitcoin client. ",1524288307

"- Load linux live CD in to memory and boot your computer

- Connect to the internet and download the crypto software you are going to create a paper wallet for.

- Once the software is installed, disconnect from the internet by either disconnecting the cable or by switching of the wifi.

- Generate private key

- Write private key down on a piece of paper and also the public address.

- Reboot computer.

- Since you where using a linux live cd from memory, nothing will have been written to disk

- Since you rebooted your computer, the key wil also not exist in memory anymore.

- Since you where not connected to the internet, nobody could have made a copy of the key while it was generated.

- Now keep this piece of paper secure, and you can type in the public address in to your computer so you can always send coins to this address.

- For people to get your coins, the only possible way is to be in your house and take the piece of paper and copy the key from there.

- NEVER EXPOSE THE PRIVATE KEY TO A COMPUTER WHERE IT CAN BE WRITTEN TO DISK OR A COMPUTER WHERE THE INTERNET CAN MAKE A COPY OF IT. 

- If eventually you need to make a transactions to move the coins away you can make this transaction the same way on a computer that  does not write to disk and is not connected to the internet.

- After the transaction is generated you can write ONLY the transaction to disk, then reboot the computer again. Now you can connect to the internet and broadcast the transaction.

"&gt; No, by donating you are distributing to the centralized political entity of your preference.

Nonsense. Example: I donate to eatbch, eatbch helps even more people. These people who would have never heard of bitcoin cash learn that their food is being paid for in bitcoin cash. Next time they find a job they ask to be paid in bitcoin cash. Next time they want to do something, they offer to pay in bitcoin cash. Hence, you redistribute by increasing the userbase.

If the userbase remains the same few people, and you burn coins to increase the value of the coins of hodlers that's just circle jerking. You are not helping adoption.

&gt;It literally distributes the value of the coins to every current holder in proportion to their current holdings.

it literally **does not**. When you have 99.99% of untapped potential, burning coins makes no sense the opportunity cost is too high. You benefit much more from donating them or even setting up a faucet. What you say would make sense only if there was an oversupply of coins.

&gt;And in doing so would instantly raise much more thorny questions. Who exactly would receive these donations? By what selection process? Who chooses the process? What if someone games the process who isn't deserving? What if it turns out that some of the coins didn't get distributed fairly? Etc.

The hungry people around the world, by an empirically proven selection process such as eatbch who has a track record or by another process such as faucet or online giveaways. Or simply spend them on bch online businesses if you really are so rich as to burn them.

&gt;A burn is (A) provable (B) completely politically neutral (C) beneficial to everyone who holds.

A burn provably wrong, there is nothing political in saving lifes, so leave politics aside. Burning them is not neutral but destructive and beneficial to no one.

No, by donating you are distributing to the centralized entity of your preference.

It literally distributes the value of the coins to every current holder in proportion to their current holdings.

And in doing so would instantly raise much more thorny questions. Who exactly would receive these donations? By what selection process? Who chooses the process? What if someone games the process who isn't deserving? What if it turns out that some of the coins didn't get distributed fairly? Etc.

"You should reconsider. The market price of all crypto has been completely blown up the last year. With things like Tether and the fact that crypto exchanges are unregulated on the crypto side there is a lot of market manipulation going on.

I would never invest more then 20% of my savings in to any crypto. If you just recently bought BCH, with the current uptick I would advise you to sell again and then only keep your current profits on the market. 

The reason why so much money can be made day trading is because a manipulated market is a predictable market.

"crypto doesn't need to be used for goods and services.

The blockchain network can be thought of as a secure distributed computing network and running ledger. One great use case of such a network that can process and log information is supply chain tracking. As long as people (*or companies!*) are paying money to add events to this running log, then the log continues to live. And as long as people are competing to add events to this log, i.e., people are competing to add transactions to the log, the cryptocurrency, the payment mechanism of the system, will continue to have value.

So as new applications come up in the crypto world, such as VEN for authenticity checking luxury items or OriginTrail for farm-to-table authenticity checking, the value of crypto increases.

Think of Ethereum, the pioneering ledger that can run code, since Ethereum has a large marketshare, anyone trying to create an application for blockchain would want to use something like Ethereum for more security and guaranteed transaction processing. And as miners, the ones that keep the ledger running are paid in Ether, Ether will continue to have value.",1524285200

"There are already exchanges offering fiat to crypto.  I use bx.in.th it transfers only to Thai bank accounts, but they are easy to set up online.  Almost every currency on there can be directly traded to and from THB {Thai Baht}, which is a double win because it's a strong currency, it has grown in value against the dollar, euro and pound every year for the past decade.  This year Thai domestic growth is predicted to be 6%, so again it'll gain value against almost all major currencies.

Not only that, but the live exchange rates and fees to all major currencies provided by Thai banks are the most competetive in the world.  You lose almost nothing exchanging dollars to THB and back.

Not only that, but coins like XZC that pay a PoS dividend to hold, get automatic payouts on their trading wallets.  

Also, before you think ""it's a dodgy site, being in Thailand"" I suggest you look at their history, zero fuckery, extremely low trading fees, one hour bank transactions (BTC can take 24 hours, trade must be 100% verified before you can cash out), good liquidity on all markets.  It's the perfect exchange for small to medium investors, whales are not given any special privileges (unlike most exchanges that give preferential treatment for whales).

This sounds like a plug, but I'm not affiliated with them, I just think all exchanges should be like this and I'm just letting you know that there are better exchanges than binance, who anally rape you with fees for every transaction and don't even give you a cash out option.",1524284251

&gt;[Once the latest transaction](http://nakamotoinstitute.org/bitcoin/#selection-197.5-225.371) in a coin is buried under enough blocks, the spent transactions before it can be discarded to save disk space. To facilitate this without breaking the block's hash, transactions are hashed in a Merkle Tree [7][2][5], with only the root included in the block's hash. Old blocks can then be compacted by stubbing off branches of the tree. The interior hashes do not need to be stored.


&gt;A block header with no transactions would be about 80 bytes. If we suppose blocks are generated every 10 minutes, 80 bytes * 6 * 24 * 365 = 4.2MB per year. With computer systems typically selling with 2GB of RAM as of 2008, and Moore's Law predicting current growth of 1.2GB per year, storage should not be a problem even if the block headers must be kept in memory.

"Bulletproofs is a general technology to implement zero-knowledge proofs.

Bitcoin does not use zero-knowledge proofs. There is no way you can just ""plug in"" Bulletproofs anywhere in Bitcoin.

Perhaps you are talking about confidential transactions (CT). This is a technique to permit a public ledger that makes the amounts hidden while still permitting everyone to verify the balances adds up. If that sounds like magic, that's because it is.

CT rely on zero-knowledge proofs. They could use Bulletproofs. They could also use other types of zero-knowledge proofs (there are several, zk-SNARKS is the well known, each with their own trade-offs). Certainly the invention of Bulletproofs made CT more accessible.

However... CT is still very different from how Bitcoin works right now. There is no obvious way to integrate them. My best hope would be using something like an extension block, where you can have coins on the ""legacy"" side or coins on the confidential side - with explicit operations to move them between the two.

However, that is far from simple, and AFAIK nobody is really working on it. Much as I love this technique and would be very excited to see it in Bitcoin, it's unrealistic to think that it will be usable anytime soon there.

"Depends where you live, what your needs are, and what your time horizon is. 

The ""fees"" of buying Bitcoin vary exchange to exchange. If you use a real exchange you're going to pay a fraction of a percent. If you're using an ATM or LBC you might be seeing higher fees. 

That ""fee"" also becomes irrelevant if the prices goes up.

Buying $50 worth of BTC on Coinbase costs 1.99 or so. If Bitcoin goes up ~3.98% that fee is wiped out in terms of purchasing power. 

If you use Coinbase's exchange, GDAX you will pay considerably less in fees. 

Bitcoin is seizure resistant and cannot be frozen as long as you control your own keys. PayPal for example will close your account or freeze your funds if they flag your account. This is not ideal as a merchant especially. 

If you live in a country where your currency is regularly devalued, has negative interest rates, or otherwise confiscated (Greece, Venezuela, Japan) Bitcoin has been invaluable.

The Nobel Prize (, Swedish pronunciation: [nʊˈbɛl]; Swedish definite form, singular: Nobelpriset; Norwegian: Nobelprisen) is a set of annual international awards bestowed in several categories by Swedish and Norwegian institutions in recognition of academic, cultural, or scientific advances.

The will of the Swedish scientist Alfred Nobel established the prizes in 1895. The prizes in Chemistry, Literature, Peace, Physics and Physiology or Medicine were first awarded in 1901. In 1968, Sveriges Riksbank (Sweden's central bank) established the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel, which has been commonly known as the Nobel Prize in Economics.

There is no real problem with financial speculation in the cryptocurrency markets, but it's disgraceful how people are shilling cryptocurrency ""investment"" as far and wide as they can, in the hopes to push the bubble further.

"Wow awesome to see a CEO like yourself reaching out to the community.   Thanks!

I believe most people also appreciate what Bitpay is trying to do, though being a technical group Bitcoiners will not agree on how best to do anything.   I think this is exactly why it's worth supporting Bitpay and following their lead.  Someone has to lead and the only way to do it is to not ask permission and just do it.   

My guess is that people who actually buy airline tickets and want to buy them with crypto on cheapair will deal with it, even if they grumble that they had to install copay or similar.   You'll have far fewer complaints of people sending to the wrong address, and as a result less actual loss of funds by your customers.  

Whomever you choose to process payments, its likely this tech will continue to evolve so there's just no way around that.   If you have a bad experience with Bitpay because of this, I certainly hope they would take that feedback and reconsider their strategy.

I for one have significantly increased my online crypto payments as a result of Bitpay having added BCH.

Everything is searchable on block explorers, if there are no BCH in it or any evidence the BCH was removed from that address, means you don't have BCH there in the first place. If the BCH was there and was moved away, Coinbase might have moved it since they have the private key. It's a very straightforward yes or no answer.

"I'll get downvoted for this but I'm only cautiously optimistic right now; rather than buying into the full blown talk of bull season I've been seeing.  I still sense that Btc is rising solely on whale manipulation to liquidate shorts.  And until it starts rising, or healthily correcting organically on high volume then I'm open to the strong possibilty that this has only been a temporary boom.  Alts have been surging but I think that's peoples desire to say ""stuff Btc"" and make quick buck.  But make no mistake they could plummet again if Btc doesn't forge ahead.  Anyway just an alternate opinion to the optimism based on the fact that we've been here before when Btc rose to 11.7k after the 6k crash.

"Since you can't trade XLM directly for fiat, its price is based on ETH or BTC depending on what pair you are looking at.  Usually, the price XLM/ETH or XLM/BTC will be close enough that it does not make a huge difference.

So basically, the ""official"" price of your XLM, for example in the ETH pair, is 0.0006409 ETH for 1 XLM.  Considering ETH can trade for FIAT (or USDT on binance), and ETH is worth 605$, then your XLM is worth 0.0006409*605=0,3877 US$.  That is how the price is ""shown"" on binance, for example.

If you'd use the BTC pair, the price of the BTC would be taken (8810$), the price of XLM against BTC is 0.00004361, so the XLM price in the XLM/BTC pair is 0.00004361*8810$=0.3842 US$.

"**Subprime mortgage crisis**

The United States subprime mortgage crisis was a nationwide banking emergency, occurring between 2007–2010, that contributed to the U.S. recession of December 2007–June 2009. It was triggered by a large decline in home prices after the collapse of a housing bubble, leading to mortgage delinquencies and foreclosures and the devaluation of housing-related securities. Declines in residential investment preceded the recession and were followed by reductions in household spending and then business investment. Spending reductions were more significant in areas with a combination of high household debt and larger housing price declines.

"because no development is needed. bitcoin was built more perfect than btc core would make you believe.

basically bitcoin didnt need any development to be used. at least could be used with minimal developemnt for a long time.

so for me the key has always been adoption. it has all been about using bitcoin everywhere as money so that you wont ever have to cash out or pay taxes again.

the dreams was that accumulate bitcoins in bitcoins, not usd. and in the new economy you will just keep living with those bitcoins and use them normally for everyhing.

instead, that dream has been damaged if not crushed.

killing off adoption isnt slow and steady.... regulators will catch up and turn bitcoin as much inti sth they like as is in their power.

"Rather than convince her about crypto, I think she needs to realise that because of inflation, money in the bank is decreasing in buying power and that working hard and saving will almost never make you rich.

Then run the (old) price of 100 cans of Coke through a 30 year compound interest calculator at about 3% (or whatever her savings account interest rate is) and see how many cans it could buy in 2018.

"first of all it doesnt matter the usd value you have. 3000 or 10000000 its all about how you alocate your portfolio in percentages.

you should do something like this

30%btc
30%eth
5% between 6 other solid proven coins like (neo, nano, monero, iota, stellar, omg)
1% in 10 other smaller more risky coins ike (ICX, 0x, VEN, EOS, CAD) among others",1524270391
"&gt;I think that cryptocurrencies are inherently flawed and cannot achieve their stated goal.  

Yeah, being created by an anonymous person wanting to take down the banks is a lofty goal. Having a fixed supply currency means they could always buy up all the coins. That might be fruitless though if you just forked it. 

I don't think adoption will be driven by the first world because it's a toy for speculators and is so volatile. I think the 3rd world and places like Venezuela will drive adoption because they have no better alternative. We won't see mass bitcoinization, it's unrealistic to think you'll get rich by buying a digital cryptographic token

&gt;Nevertheless, the bitcoin protocol was a very clever idea, and cryptos have raised many interesting technical problems.  For example, designing a difficulty adjustment algorithm that would do its job even when miners can freely and quickly switch between two or more cryptos.

I agree. I think some of the ones incorporating real sensors are clever ideas. Being able to cryptographically verify a box has never been opened over the Internet is amazing. You have to be able to trust the hardware and software though

&gt;Ditto for the LN.  It was a clever idea, but once one looks closely it should be obvious that cannot possibly achieve its goals.  Nevertheless it brings up many interesting technical insights and problems of its own

I did graduate work on path planning so I think it's an interesting challenge planning routes with multiple agents in a graph worth constantly changing weights. 

If you look at any of the papers, existing algorithms are not able to do that. All the algorithms sacrifice completeness and decentralization or only work on specific graph types. I think the only way it would ever work is centralized hubs with only two hops or some new algorithm that completely revolutionizes the multiple agent planning space. 

That's quite a hail mary to be betting on the latter. They are just using single agent A* right now and even with the few nodes in the beta test, paths are already failing from incompleteness

"I’m sorry for your loss. 

&amp;nbsp;

One thing that jumped out as a no-no was the idea of transferring your brother’s coins to your wallet since you’re going to be the executor of his estate.  **Don’t do this for two reasons.** 

&amp;nbsp;

First, an estate has its own bank accounts where assets of the deceased are deposited.  Even if you were the sole beneficiary of your brother’s estate, it would not be legally proper to move assets from your brother’s accounts — bank, brokerage, or crypto.  In your capacity as executor (or administrator if your brother had no will), you still should be depositing your brother’s assets in accounts in the name of his estate (accounts that you’d have legal authority to create and distribute).  So for crypto, once you have the PIN/seed, you’d want to create a new wallet in the name of the estate and park the crypto there. 

&amp;nbsp;

The second reason is the tax consequences of distributing the assets of an estate.  Not sure of Colorado’s state estate tax landscape offhand, but there’s a tax difference, on the federal level, between distributing the assets of an estate and simply transferring the assets of a decedent to a survivor (like a bank account with a designated pay-on-death beneficiary). 

&amp;nbsp;

Once you get the probate order from the Colorado court in the county of your brother’s residence, I suggest you contact a local attorney there.  In fact, that attorney can likely help you get the letters rogatory that provide you with legal authority to administer the estate.  

&amp;nbsp;

This is one of the rare instances where an Americqn exchange has a benefit for crypto-storage, because (at least Gemini and Coinbase) will transfer a decedent’s account holdings to an executor’s account once presented with the court order (letters rogatory), and a certificate of death. Not suggesting at all that your brother should have done this — just a note on how estate law and crypto intersect. 

&amp;nbsp;

And again, I’m sorry to hear your brother was called home so early.  You know you’ll get to walk together again further on down the road. 

&amp;nbsp;

Be well.

"The problem is that if you have 50 devices running 50 different versions of software there are 50 possible security threats because every device is connected to the internet. If one device is compromised, an attacker gains access to the whole network like in the case where a casino got hacked through a thermometer in their fishtank and the hacker stole private information of their customers.

By using Elastos instead you only have 1 point of attack, the Elastos runtime, which is the only way to access the network (dApps dont have direct access to the network). Communacting over the Elastos smart web requires an ID which is registered on the Elastos ID chain, secured with merged mining with BTC.  
Large miners like Bitmain already pledged to merge mine ELA with BTC and Elastos is expected to have more than 50% of the total Bitcoin hashrate.

"When you use a stable commodity money, like gold (and perhaps BCH in the future) you'll be amazed at how relatively stable the oil price can be.

In recent years, oil prices have fluctuated from $30 to $160 in terms of dollars. And they have been in an upward trajectory overall. Many years ago, the very low $30-$60 price we see today would have been a very high one. Today it is a very low price.

Meanwhile, priced in gold, oil keeps on trading in a range where you can buy anywhere from 10 to 25 barrels for an ounce of gold, going back centuries. Now that's stable pricing! (As stable as it gets, anyway.)

In any event, right now, oil is exceptionally cheap, whether you use dollars or gold or Bitcoin, even though it has doubled in dollar terms the past year. Look for it to go up further (along with all other commodities) over the next few years.",1524267882
Thanks for clarification - and yes I'd agree that neither chain is strictly compatible with the chain prior to the split.

"I think it’s different for each country. We elect our politician, so they vote for our views in parliament. They have to balance between voting for their party (to stay part of that party) and voting for us (to get re-elected). 

I believe a democracy should dictate. I am strongly against Brexit, but we should leave because the majority voted for it. If I don’t like it, which I don’t, that’s tough. I moan, but it’s fair. I think the same applies for tax. I would argue tax is more moral because it aids the unfortunate (whether that be intelligence, illness or nurture). It’s a robinhood effect, but with luck instead. It takes from the lucky and gives to the unlucky. There are downsides, that people get free rides that don’t deserve it, but it helps enough people that I can get over that. 

Most people would say where we get to in our careers isn’t luck, but most of it is genetic or nurture. From the way you react to this sentence, to the way I write it, it’s 90%+ affected by external events that we have no control over. For that reason, I think it’s fair to level the playing field a little. There should still be a competitive work environment, though. Otherwise that breeds laziness.

I would disagree with your last sentence because it sets a different precedence for crypto. That’s a way to create hatred for it. For it to be successful it has to fit in. Fit in but be better.

Essentially its a social network that is running on the blockchain. So all the benefits that the blockchain offers, the reasons we use blockchain technology for transfering money and trust it to do so, are now available to a social network. 

Zero censorship, as the BCH blockchain is immutable. Sure this means that if you post something, its forever - there isn't any deleting, but thats the trade off to true freedom of speech. What you say is now yours, forever and is accessible forever. 

Its beta twitter on blockchain. Every user is just a bitcoin cash address. You can name your account by sending a transaction to the blockchain. You can post a ""memo"" of up to 60 characters by sending it as a transaction on the blockchain. You can follow a user by sending that command as a transaction on the blockchain. You can like a post by sending that command as a transaction on the blockchain. 

V2 is in the works and will add the ability to reply to posts, create a text profile for your account, attach images, set your profile picture, and repost or ""retweet"" a post.

"**K Foundation Burn a Million Quid**

K Foundation Burn a Million Quid was an action on 23 August 1994 in which the K Foundation (an art duo consisting of Bill Drummond and Jimmy Cauty) burned cash in the amount of one million pounds sterling in a disused boathouse on the Ardfin Estate on the Scottish island of Jura. The money represented the bulk of the K Foundation's funds, earned by Drummond and Cauty as The KLF, one of the United Kingdom's most successful pop groups of the early 1990s.

The incineration was recorded on a Hi-8 video camera by K Foundation collaborator Gimpo. In August 1995, the film—Watch the K Foundation Burn a Million Quid—was toured around the UK, with Drummond and Cauty engaging each audience in debate about the burning and its meaning.

I really appreciate your post and where you're at. I too was once a BTC champion. 

Your comment really strikes at the heart of my intentions posting what I did in r/bitcoin. I see Memo.cash as a giant leap forward in thinking about how the blockchain can be used. Yes, it runs on BCH, but that was not the point of my post. 

/u/chaintip 

Taste and see that the BCH is good; blessed is the one who takes refuge in it. ;) Bahaha jk, but seriously, try it for yourself man. If you're new to the space and/or are unfamiliar with why BCH uses the name Bitcoin (other than bcash bcash ver's a cuck bcash bcash) spend some more time around r/btc and you're bound to hear some things that should, if they haven't already, make you curious. 

If you're not new and/or you are familiar, then in all seriousness thanks for keeping a level head. I absolutely respect your opinion even though it differs from my own. BTC as a technology has made some drastic turns from its theoretical foundations, which isn't inherently a bad thing. 

Opinion - The reason it is a bad thing in this case is because of everything that came with the change, like censorship in the r/bitcoin community for example. The dwindling of development to one sole developing team to which all of BTC looks to, hopes for and leans upon. Bitcoin, the technology, is not what it was or was intended to be, based on it's own whitepaper and it's in the place that it is today because of malicious intent. These reasons are why the drastic change was bad. ",1524263073

"I am the one who requested semi-protection on the [Bitcoin Cash wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin_Cash) and by the comments I'm reading it looks like some clarification is needed.

First of all, mods just check requests like [this one](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_page_protection&amp;oldid=837383022#Bitcoin_Cash) about protection and [decide](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_page_protection&amp;oldid=837395855#Bitcoin_Cash) what to do.

So why did I request for semi-protection, which for those unfamiliar with wikipedia jargon means that only registered (signed in) users can edit the page? First, because no one else did, despite crying loud on this sub, which is generally useless to reach wider audiences or specific ones like the wikipedia mods. Second, because semi-protection is standard practice against vandalism coming from unregistered users: the one-month protection is also standard practice but it's a mod decision. If I were a mod, I personally would have used one-month too. After the month expires, requests can be reiterated (you know how to do that now) and the protection may be longer or even permanent. Third, because vandalism came systematically from unregistered users. If a user motivates their changes with relevant sources and consensus is reached, their edit may be confirmed regardless of their, or any editor's  position.",1524262650

Crypto is code, and code either works or not doesn't. And what is obvious is that BCH works a helluva lot better than BTC. And that Core devs have duped the entire BTC community into thinking Lightning will solve all their problems.

I hope they see posts like this one when they finally realize that BTC literally painted itself into a corner with their stance on scaling and forking.

"&gt; dont worry

This is the anthem of the new apathetic ""generation whatever.""  Don't worry, things will be fine. Don't worry, be happy.  New York bitlicense?  Don't worry about that, we're in (California, Texas, whatever).  It could never happen here.  Right?  Don't worry, bitlicense only took root in New York.  Oh, I mean in New York and North Carolina, because nobody was paying attention.

And now, Connecticut. Hawaii. Nebraska. and Alaska (note that in Alaska it's been defeated once before, but that's not stopping the bitlicense proponents in Coin Center and ULC from pumping it there).

This community is filled with people who cannot commit to any effort at all to help advocate to protect the states from these insane proposals.  I think honestly that your thinking is ""don't worry EFF or someone will take care of it.""  You don't seem to think you have to do anything.  

***You are wrong.***

I worked tirelessly for years to defeat bitlicense in California. I never asked for nor received anything for my advocacy.  I lost track of the thousands of hours I spent helping to defeat it not once, but three times.  If you are in California you owe the fact that you can use bitcoin in this state without being prosecuted not only to me but to quite a few others who also put in the time and of course to EFF as they provided tools to help people engage on the issue.  But without people putting in the time that would have been for nothing!

Also, it would be interesting to get the correlation value between historic transaction values and historic price. That being said, you may be very right. I honestly don't know.

Essentially making both XLM and RMT altcoins.  BTC/ETH/LTC are not however because you can trade them directly against USD on Coinbase an other FIAT onramps...

Some coins that have FIAT onramps in Korean exchanges against KRW (Korean Won) are however also considered altcoins since they don't have a USD-based onramp. The cryptospace don't have any clear definitions here on exactly what makes a coin/token qualify for not being an altcoin.",1524256881

"Hardware is what will negates that cost.

A block needs to be processed fast enough to ensure low orphan risks. As more transactions are verified you increase the orphan risk.

All you need to negate that is more powerful verification computers. The computers to verify transactions will become more expensive as they need to process more transactions in specific amount of time, but the overall cost of those machines will be paid for by the block reward and the tiny fees from large amounts of users.

The terabyte block paper goes into the details of what kind of machine would be needed, but that it can process everything in  an appropriate amount of time. 

http://blog.vermorel.com/journal/2017/12/17/terabyte-blocks-for-bitcoin-cash.html

In some other video he did later, he revised his numbers after being more knowledgeable and it was a massive reduction cost vs what this paper said  while was already possible and profitable.

"From section 2.5 ""HMRC's understanding is that each cryptocurrency is fungible (individual units are of such nature or kind so as to be interchangeable)"" 
However one of the issues with bitcoin and many other crypto with public blockchains is that a coins history is visible to all. So a coin previously used on the silk road will have a different value to a freshly mined coin, hence the phenomena of tainted coins. I guess all the coins from the same source could go into the same pool.

"Conspiracy hat time:

I see it as reasonable that crypto could be a way for the people of the world to move away from Fiat currencies. However, this would take unimaginable power and control away from those that have the ability to manipulate it - therefore, some people have a strong incentive to try and get rid of it.

The collapse of the dollar, could potentially be the turning point for people to turn to crypto, and so some methods have been employed to try and destroy(or at least stifle) crypto from becoming the mainstream.

One of the best ways to do this, is possibly corrupt crypto from the inside(hello bcore), and the back up plan is something like the Tether Bomb.

Although it may not fully stop crypto, if it is set of at the right time, it could possibly destroy us.

"It's clear to me why it's better then BTC. BTC is controlled by fanatics and BCH has atleast a more rational team of devs you can reason with. Also lighting sucks IMHO.

You brought up one particular side-case where BCH could be a better solution then ETH (""money transfer only"", ""simple to use"" contracts sweet spot). This is not the same as showing that ""in general"" BCH is better then ETH (which would require reviewing many, many, many more aspects). 


While I agree Blockstream destroyed  BTC I'd say that BTC was scaling just fine before Blockstream because the TX rates were relatively low back then compared to now. If you design a system that scales fine to X it will scale fine to X. It's not a valid claim to, beyond that point X, say""well it was scaling fine to X so if you would not have changed anything it would scale fine now as well"". You can't know. The fact that the BCH hardfork increased the BLocksize atleast is evidence that it would not scale. Now if you say ""Block size increase IS the scaling solution for BCH"". Okay. Fair enough. But then again my question: this will not work forever so what's the plan after that? 

Experiene is important, you're right. But saying ""there have been bugs, they have been fixed, it's fine now"" is just false. Even if there would be no changes to the code there's still a chance new bugs are found. But that is not even true: future and HUGHE code changes are annoucned (re-intreducing OP-codes and even adding new functions is NOT trivial and has HUGHE bug potential and - to come back to the ETH comparison: it's one thing to build a decentralized order book but very different thing to build a decentralized turing machine. Doing op-codes the right way is way more complex then many other parts of the Bitcoin protocol). With every change there's a risk to get new bugs. 
""Age"" of a software project is NOT a good measure for security. Experienced devs, fine. But Experienced devs not only moved to BCH but to nearly every single other crypto project.

The transaction fees earned by miners are an important growth indicator of the BCH ecosystem, and if a portion of the fees are burnt, it is effectively miners sharing revenue with the entire BCH network.”

&gt;Coin Days Destroyed does demonstrate that there is more economic activity in Bitcoin compared to BCH. It demonstrates that there is more economic activity not just because Bitcoins price is higher; but because more/older coins are moved around.

Yes agreed. You absolutely can infer this from the data.  I think what you were inferring from this, that there are far fewer BCH holders than BTC holders was unjustified by this data though, because no matter what, given that BTC has more economic activity CDD will be greater on BTC than BCH.

&gt;I don't think its much of an unjustified leap to say that if you split a network in ""half"" ; but one half instantly becomes worth 10% of the other ""half"" and less coins are moved around ; that would indicate that most users are on the ""half"" that is worth more and moves more coins around. Would you disagree with that?

No, not really. I think the average Bitcoiner who was awarded BCH by the fork is either unaware they have BCH, or waiting on the sidelines to figure out what's going to become of BCH post split.

"&gt;I'm asking you this because my opinion is that once you have a certain amount of node diversity-- in terms of the geography of the nodes--and node count, you're already highly protected from the ledger being taken offline, to the point where each additional copy of the ledger is adding a negligible amount of additional protection.

My opinion is that each unique node (run by a different person/organization in a unique location) is important towards decentralization. 

My opinion is that there is never a stopping point where a protocol is sufficiently decentralized. If a protocol wants to remain independent and uncontrolled by a central authority then it must always be increasing decentralization; at least until we reach full saturation where every human is running a node, which will never happen.

Centralizing forces are very strong ; decentralization must always be pursued to keep Bitcoin free.

Coin Days Destroyed does demonstrate that there is more economic activity in Bitcoin compared to BCH. It demonstrates that there is more economic activity not just because Bitcoins price is higher; but because more/older coins are moved around.

I don't think its much of an unjustified leap to say that if you split a network in ""half"" ; but one half instantly becomes worth 10% of the other ""half"" and less coins are moved around ; that would indicate that most users are on the ""half"" that is worth more and moves more coins around.

"2. YUP!  I'm upset that this was done with my hardware without any input from me.  I get it, I'm mining using a pool, so this is the risk I take.  I'll act accordingly, by moving to another pool.

1.  My logic is that, if you read the announcement, they are criticizing ""maximalism"" of a single crypto.  There exists a very real threat to the BTC chain due to the fact that difficulty adjusts every 12 days (unlike BCH, which adjusts every block).  If miners can make more money by mining BCH, and enough of them switch at the wrong time for BTC (when the difficulty is high, and the adjustment is far away), chain-death can occur.  If that happens, their BTC holdings quickly become worthless.

I'm probably just being irrational though, because I'm mad that I'm suddenly losing out on 12% of my hard-earned satoshis.  It doesn't make sense that all of the BTC miners would switch to BCH that quickly, since they'd lose out on their BTC value as well.  Though... I'm now paranoid that Bitmain would prefer if the status quo stays the way it is, with BCH forever being the little brother to BTC.

The more time that passes, the more I think that I'm just reacting emotionally.

Regardless, I'm switching pools.",1524252433

"It is still active here:

"&gt; Because there is a choice now. People could transact in gold and silver. It's quite easy... but they choose not to out of convenience.

Gold and silver actually aren't that easy to contract in; compared to fiat-paper they have significant transaction costs. 

And in terms of value they are highly manipulated in price by sovereign powers to keep them from becoming a viable money, ie: the price has been held down by the advent of paper-gold. This problem is so big that there is now 300 times more paper-gold than physical gold on the planet.

If that had not occurred, people would be using gold to save and also to transact with, since many more people would have it, creating a larger network effect.

But the government is completely unable to counterfeit bitcoin in the same way that they've created paper-gold.

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;&gt;And a reasonable, rational person realizes that they don't want to lose value because of that, and thus bought crypto.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; False. My father in law thinks he is incredibly reasonable, and rational... but he nothing but an old statist who believes in the use of force to change the human condition... and he never bought crypto. I'd warn you that you live in a bubble, a bubble of your own making... and you are too frightened to look outside your own bubble... but you won't listen.

Does he have significant savings in cash? I mean, at the very least odinary people realize a CD is better than losing money to inflation. I've heard even 20 somethings parrot this kind of advice, even though it's not great advice even. 

Bitcoin is still risky, average people realize that some form of wealth protection is a good idea, and crypto will increasingly enter their consciousness as it establishes itself and its track-record.

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 

&gt;&gt;but do you have any doubt that if they had easy ways out that they wouldn't do the same as the rich?
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Absolutely I have doubt. Again, you don't want to admit to yourself how fucking stupid the human race really is. I'll point back to democracy.

Democracy was a step forward, even if it wasn't forward enough. I wouldn't cite democracy as an instance of stupidity necessarily. They simply didn't have the concepts needed back then to advance any further than democracy.

But here's the great thing, once they saw that democracy was superior to monarchy, they switched. In many places with little trouble.

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;&gt;People realize inflation is robbing them of purchasing power
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; No, they don't. They do not. 

They absolutely do.

&gt;Almost everything you are saying is projection. 

No, I worked in a financial capacity in the past, helping families craft a strategy to escape debt and invest for the future. I have at least some experience in what ordinary people think about money.

Google ""inflation and savings"" first link:

[How Inflation Affects Your Cash Savings](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/090715/how-inflation-affects-your-cash-savings.asp)

&gt;&gt; ""Let’s say you have $100 in a savings account that pays a 1% interest rate. After a year, you will have $101 in your account. During this period, if inflation runs 2%, you would have to have $102 to make up for the impact of higher prices. Since you will only have $101 in your account, you have actually lost some purchasing power. If your savings don’t grow to reflect this rise in prices over time, the effect will be as though you are actually losing money.""

The far bigger issue is that we've built a debt-based economy where most people don't have any significant savings at all, so they don't have a lot of incentive to care, and have been propagandized that inflation is good for borrowers, etc. 

They don't understand how inflation lets the government steal wealth from them, but they DO understand at least that inflation is robbing them of purchasing power and it's something that needs to be avoided when you save money long term--they absolutely do understand that, it's common sense and you will get just about everyone to agree that you shouldn't save in the form of cash due to inflation.

&gt; You really want to believe what you are saying. I'm just here to tell you that you are wrong. You don't have to believe me, I make you uncomfortable. It's what I do.

You just sound like you've given in to pessimism about the average person.

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Bitcoin has been around for almost 10 years. Most who own it are the wealthy and those trying to make more fiat. The pool of folks who own bitcoin based on their own ideology(like precious metals holders) are few and far between.

In 2013 it was estimated that as much as 40% of early adopters to that point were libertarian minded.



&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; More projecting. I've not given up hope at all. I just know my enemy. Crypto will not save the human race. It will change the human race, a lot.... but it won't get rid of the worlds largest religion which is statism and the desire to impose the collective will on others via force.

According to Rothbard, control of money is the key position the state must have control of in the modern world, from which it derives most of its power and wealth.

Crypto can take that away progressively. Especially if govs begin doing negative interest rates--which ARE currently being done in Japan, iirc, and Japan is also a hotbed of crypto activity.

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;&gt;Reasonable in this case simply means they don't want to lose money. That's everyone.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; You sure? I'm a very reasonable person. I work with a lot of reasonable people. Know how many people I told to buy Bitcoin @ $270? Lots. Know how many people I told to buy ETH @ $50? Lots. Know how many listened? None.

There's confounding variables there--the risk of crypto being new, the high technical knowledge needed to evaluate that risk accurately. That is tangential to the fact that people don't want to lose money. The average person at that time simply couldn't evaluate the risk of crypto to know if it was a winning or losing risk. 

Today the world is a lot more sure that crypto is here to stay.

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;&gt;We simply have to demonstrate another way is possible and that the results it produces are desirable
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Hmmmm. Demonstrate others ways are possible like Rothbard, Hayek, Friedman, Rand and Hoppe among many many others? People have been shouting from the rooftops for a millenia that there are other ways.

Shouting is not demonstration. I'm talking about building ancap cities, via seasteading, that use crypto as a primary currency.

&gt; They are all censored and silenced. Yeshua taught to teach a man to fish, not give him a fish. He was murdered for it. Socrates didn't acknowledge the god's of the city and was charged with 'corrupting the youth'... he was democratically murdered for it.

That is partly why Satoshi remained anonymous.

But those people still changed the world.

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;&gt;Is this not the exact way that the world shed monarchy and adopted democracy?
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; I will concede this one point. Humanity is in fact moving towards a more decentralized power structure, but again, this still does not do away with the worlds largest religion and institutionalized violence and rape.

They, ordinary people, believe that the current way is the only viable way.

It is to us to demonstrate that another way is viable, only then will those people have a viable choice.

At that time, they will choose, and we can trust self-interest that they will choose correctly.

"Do you understand how the consensus mechanisms differ, and how different consensus methods differ in general? No one system is better than the other, they each sacrifice different properties. This isn't opinion, I'm just stating a fact. Nano is amazing, and I see great things in store for it, but it is not, nor ever will be as secure as Bitcoin (assuming bitcoin stays as somewhat relative, which I believe it will). Nano sacrifices security for no transaction fees due to easy proof of work. It makes free transactions in a decentralized (more centralized than bitcoin or ethereum, but still decentralized) manner which is an amazing technological feat, but it is still an unproven system. Bitcoin has been around for 9 years now without any security issues.

"&gt;The fact that gold is desired as a ""good"" in and of itself.
&gt;&gt;this is not necessary for BCH to be money, if you'd bother to read the link. in fact, money is superior when it transcends any previous value as a good or commodity and only becomes money in and of itself. and Bitcoin proves that that is not a necessary precondition.

Ah, this is what I like to call the ""McGuffin"" theory of money. ""Money can be *anything*, maaaaaaannnnnnn, as long as we all *agreeeeeee*.""

No, it can't be anything. It has to have a real utility value. It cannot be entirely arbitrary. 

In the case of dollars, that value is derived from legal tender laws (the fact that if you don't accept it you'll go to jail) as well as from the fact that hundreds of millions of people and businesses need it to pay taxes and debts.

In the case of BCH, the utility value is that is grants access to secure public ledger transactions. And that's wonderful.

BCH does indeed have a real commodity value, and is a ""good"" in its own right. If it couldn't be used to do *anything* valuable, it could not serve as money, ever. 

""Popular delusion"" is not a viable long-term strategy for sustaining asset prices. Economic fundamentals always assert themselves.

&gt;In addition to its demand as a ""good"" in its own right, gold also has unique supply characteristics that BTC cannot emulate.
&gt;&gt;you stated this as a fact with no supporting arguments. 

That's just not true though. The next following paragraph is all supporting arguments. Here it is again:

&gt;The cost to add to the supply of gold closely tracks real energy costs, and varying the degree of energy that is thrown at gold will vary the amount of new gold that is brought to market. Bitcoin mining simply does not mimic this important characteristic. The implications of this are profound and under-appreciated.

&gt;&gt;what is wrong with the 21M coin supply? 

1. Scarcity is not a source of value in and alf itself. It can only help to set a price *floor*. Otherwise, mercury would be worth as much as silver.

2. If you throw more energy at Bitcoin do you get more Bitcoins? No. If you throw less energy at Bitcoin do you get fewer Bitcoins? No. If the demand for Bitcoin decreases, does the new mining supply fall? No. These are but a few aspects of gold that Bitcoin mining cannot and does not mimic.

&gt;&gt;you don't think it's immutable? 

Well, obviously it's not. A majority decision could fork the chain to one that has an expanding currency supply at any time. But even without that, the possible number of competing cryptos is infinite. That reality cannot be dismissed. It is why BCH must be (and so far is) incredibly competitive with other options.

&gt;in fact, gold inflates 2% per year from new supply 

Yes, and this is one of the traits that makes it serve so well as a unit of account. The gold supply increases at almost exactly the same rate as the human population, keeping purchasing power relatively stable and predictable. 

(Though supply is often far lower than 2%, and sometimes higher, depending on the profitability and demand for new gold. The supply is completely market based. Like BCH blocksize.)

Incidentally, this is completely different than targeting 2% CPI ""inflation"". That requires dude amounts of money printing—even if the data weren't manipulated to create an artificially low number. 

That is because even though gold increases in quantity by an average around 2% per year, in line with population growth, prices *still fall in terms of gold over time* due to increases in productivity.

&gt;with a real and present threat that asteroid mining or ocean trolling will discover huge new supplies.

Haha, now that one is just silly, because it completely negates that fact that there are *costs* to deep sea mining and asteroid mining. Huge costs. Much larger than the costs of conventional mining!

It's amazing how many people miss this when it should be so incredibly obvious. It's like saying ""gold should be cheap, you can always just dig it out of the ground!""

95% of people will be using bank tokens (they can't actually onramp to the blockchain) you are assuming hubs will not issue more money substitutes than they have. 

A user could have a fractional reserve BTC balance with a v2.0Bank (aka LN Hub) the bank an LN hub will give them a balance to spend on an LN channel as and when needed. BTC in a channel will earn no interest - BTC in the fractional reserve pool will earn interest (aka fees), this will encourage users to allow 2.0 banks to have fractional reserves.

and we are back where we started with fractional reserve lending only backed by BTC. the solution is consumers settling on chain, so long as there is capacity for consumers to withdraw their BTC on chain to a key they control the fractional reserve 2.o banking will remain viable.

Looked at your comment. Your conjecture is not justified from the data and is in fact an overreach. We would expect coin days destroyed to be more on any chain that has more economic activity, regardless of any other factors. The idea behind coin days destroyed was to give a better concept of economic activity that could not be spoofed by the same person moving coins back and forth from the same addresses.

&gt; The greater number of nodes; the more nodes that must be taken offline to destroy Bitcoin ledger.

Can you be more precise about the value this metric is adding? Is it better when different entities control the nodes or does it not matter? Are there diminishing returns to having more nodes? Is going from 10000 nodes to 1 billion nodes 100000 more decentralizing or was the jump from single digit nodes significantly to 10000 more decentralizing? 

I'm asking you this because my opinion is that once you have a certain amount of node diversity-- in terms of the geography of the nodes--and node count, you're already highly protected from the ledger being taken offline, to the point where each additional copy of the ledger is adding a negligible amount of additional protection.

"&gt; I've been maybe one of the most outspoken critics of non-cash use cases of BCH and tokenization in general. 

I got in many a battle back in the early days with some pretty noteworthy Core devs, who were bitching about Satoshi Dice ruining Bitcoin by *gasp* using the blockchain.   

Often, the founder of a tech startup will have an initial vision of product usage.  And often the customers will come up with a different use.  Those companies that listen to their customers are the ones that successfully pivot and grow to their potential.

So I wouldn't sweat it with other uses.

Imagine this scenario - imagine the colored coin scenario where a satoshi actually represents a share of stock (which might be $100).  Or when (like Ethereum) people are using the blockchain to represent alternate ledgers.  In both those scenarios, there is huge incentives for the vested parties to ensure that the base coin level has high value and that miners are compensated fairly.  Because if you have a coin with market cap of $18B supporting industries of, say, $18T, you end up with a high motivation for shenanigans.

So I say bring it on.  Welcome paid uses of the blockchain.  Especially those of high value.",1524249541
"It's a slow and very long process. Back when the regulation was enacted, there is a 90 days window to challenge in court and back then there were very few lawyers that knew what a bitcoin was.
           
The lawyers already established wanted the bitlicense so they could charge high fees and told me and other that I was a pariah.      
               
No lawyer wanted to take my case because they could grasp what a bitcoin was so I was left with doing it own my own.             
                 
Training a lawyer back then would have taken more than the 90 days window allowed. When all said and done, training my lawyer took literally 18 month and the belief that I will pay him *(which I did from my 401(k))*.

The gender binary, also referred to as gender binarism (sometimes shortened to just binarism), is the classification of sex and gender into two distinct, opposite and disconnected forms of masculine and feminine. Gender binary is one general type of a gender system. Sometimes in this binary model, ""sex"", ""gender"" and ""sexuality"" are assumed by default to align. For example, when a male is born, gender binarism assumes the male will be masculine in appearance, character traits, and behavior, including having a heterosexual attraction to females.

And when you hear others use the phrase, it'll hit you in the face like a wet salami that they are ignorant, uninformed, untrained white belts.

"&gt; node can immediately validate if it was previously double-spend and within maybe 3 seconds we can say with certainty that no double-spend has been send.

It makes it a whole whopping fraction of a second faster! Most of the time it takes less than a second for a transaction to hop between a sender's wallet, to the network, and then from the network to the merchant. Shortcutting this so the transaction goes directly to the merchant only shaves a tiny percentage off, not enough to be significant. Not to mention this method only really faster if the merchant runs a full node. If the merchant uses a remote node, it has to make the network hop anyways, so the speedup is even more lessened.

The only benefit that I can think of that comes from the sender giving the tx to the merchant before giving it to the network is:

1. that it allows the merchant to validate the fee, so that the merchant doesn't have to deal with the fee being too low, but this isn't really a problem in BCH, it's only a problem for BTC where blocks are always full and tx fee matters a lot.

1. It allows the merchant to not broadcast the tx to the network if the sender's wallet accidentally messes up the transaction in some way. This should never happen anyways, if the sender scans the address and amount via QR code.",1524248938

Crypto isn't left or right, it's libertarian free-market economics.

Neo-cons also believe in Keynesian economics. Read the wiki article on the Broken Window Fallacy, specifically this part:

&gt;The argument can be made that war is a benefactor to society, since historically it often has focused the use of resources and triggered advances in technology and other areas while reducing unemployment. The increased production and employment associated with war often cause some people to claim that ""war is good for the economy."" However, this belief is often given as an example of the broken window fallacy. The money spent on the war effort, for example, is money that cannot be spent on food, clothing, health care, or other industries. The stimulus felt in one sector of the economy comes at a direct – but hidden – cost to other sectors.

&gt;Bastiat himself argued against the claim that hiring men to be soldiers was inherently beneficial to the economy in the second chapter of That Which is Seen, and That Which is Not Seen, ""The Disbanding of Troops"".

&gt;According to Hazlitt:

&gt;It is never an advantage to have one’s plants destroyed by shells or bombs unless those plants have already become valueless or acquired a negative value by depreciation and obsolescence. ... Plants and equipment cannot be replaced by an individual (or a socialist government) unless he or it has acquired or can acquire the savings, the capital accumulation, to make the replacement. But war destroys accumulated capital. ... Complications should not divert us from recognizing the basic truth that the wanton destruction of anything of real value is always a net loss, a misfortune, or a disaster, and whatever the offsetting considerations in a particular instance, can never be, on net balance, a boon or a blessing.

Trump was a [classical liberal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_liberalism) before running as a Republican, his views haven't changed much, it's the parties that did. It's now establishment war-hawk social democrats on one side, and establishment socialist war-hawk neo-cons on the right.

Truth be told, I hold my BCH that I mine, and I'm sure many miners are like me.  Whenever I spend, I always spend-and-replace.  Plenty of us are good stewards of the coin in that sense.  I don't need AntPool making these decisions for me.  /u/MemoryDealers tell me that the Bitcoin.com pool won't be participating in this central planning bullshit, and I'll switch over today.

Because there is a choice now. People could transact in gold and silver. It's quite easy... but they choose not to out of convenience.

False.

'Even'? They realized this due to their economy collapsing. Go to Canada, or wealthy European countries.

Absolutely I have doubt. Again, you don't want to admit to yourself how fucking stupid the human race really is. I'll point back to democracy.

No, they don't. They do not. Almost everything you are saying is projection. You *really* want to believe what you are saying. I'm just here to tell you that you are wrong. You don't have to believe me, I make you uncomfortable. It's what I do.

&gt; That's the whole reason that bitcoin was created as a decentralized P2P app, because, as Satoshi said, governments seem to be unable to shut-down decentralized applications of this sort. That's why he created the blockchain, a decentralized ledger, that solves many problems at once.

Bitcoin has been around for almost 10 years. Most who own it are the wealthy and those trying to make more fiat. The pool of folks who own bitcoin based on their own ideology(like precious metals holders) are few and far between.

&gt; You sound like you've given up hope on changing the world through crypto

More projecting. I've not given up hope at all. I just know my enemy. Crypto will not save the human race. It will change the human race, a lot.... but it won't get rid of the worlds largest religion which is statism and the desire to impose the collective will on others via force. 

&gt; Reasonable in this case simply means they don't want to lose money. That's everyone.

You sure? I'm a very reasonable person. I work with a lot of reasonable people. Know how many people I told to buy Bitcoin @ $270? Lots. Know how many people I told to buy ETH @ $50? Lots. Know how many listened? None.

&gt; We simply have to demonstrate another way is possible and that the results it produces are desirable

Hmmmm. Demonstrate others ways are possible like Rothbard, Hayek, Friedman, Rand and Hoppe among many many others? People have been shouting from the rooftops for a millenia that there are other ways. They are all censored and silenced. Yeshua taught to teach a man to fish, not give him a fish. He was murdered for it. Socrates didn't acknowledge the god's of the city and was charged with 'corrupting the youth'... he was democratically murdered for it.

Also the fact that you bought something from a merchant with a given amount of BTC will be visible in blockchain. And then next merchant can see what shops you have been using, and with what amounts.

 [Debt: The First 5,000 Years](https://www.amazon.com/Debt-First-5-000-Years/dp/1612191290)

It's interesting throughout history what has been accepted and worked as money/currency.  I think that we only have recent history as a reference so only trust government issued fiat which keeps having diminishing purchasing power because of it's endless supply.  

Basically it seems anything can work as a currency as long as there is network effect and trust is developed.  There's even examples of silver that is stored but never ever even moved that act as a store of value while grains act the medium of exchange that are back up by silver in Sumerian civilization.

"Trac having some solid gains and has huge potential. Read below if you haven't convinced yourself to buy.

Everyone has their own reasons for choosing a coin to invest in, but I keep it pretty simple:

1. Dev Team

Do they have faces online? LinkedIn or some other professional biography? Go check out the team page on OT's website. Every single one of them has a LinkedIn Profile. Their reputations are front and center; and there is a face and work history to every name. That's important. Check it out yourself: https://origintrail.io/#team

2. Longevity/history

Edit: it's been brought to my attention that OT implemented blockchain in late 2016. Thus, despite their track record of tracing organic beef starting in 2013, they didn't start using blockchain until late 2016/very early 2017.

Teams working on a project for a longer period are more likely to stick with the project.

You may not know this, but OT has been working on their product since 2013 and became operational in 2015. Oh, that doesn't sound that exciting to you? Let me rephrase that, OT has been working on their product longer than Ethereum. You heard me.

Ethereum was first proposed in December of 2013 by Vitalik Buterin. OriginTrail has been tracking organic beef since before Vitalik even proposed ETH. Let that sink in for a moment.

Source 1: https://origintrail.io/storage/documents/overview_document-english(Jan%209).pdf

Source 2: https://cryptowithoutborders.com/tag/origin-trail/

Source 3: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethereum

3. Actually solving a need in the market

One of the first questions I ask myself about a coin/token is, ""What does this coin/token do? Is there a need/demand for it?"" OT is pretty clear in the problem they want to solve. Supply chain data is fragmented and difficult to track. In the supply industry, this is a notorious problem. OT wants to end that, or at least make it much more manageable not by creating their own blockchain, but by making already existing and future blockchains interoperable.

In case you missed it, OT can track beef, dairy, vegetables, wine, and other food products from the farm to the shelf. To give an idea of fraud in food supply chains, 70% of wine in China is fake: https://cpianalysis.org/2017/01/16/fake-wine-in-china/

33% of fish in the USA is mislabled: http://www.wsj.com/video/beware-of-fake-fish-in-restaurants-and-seafood-shops/BF80613A-22B5-4909-BF43-0A01DEE3287A.html

76% of honey in the USA doesn't pass FDA standards for actually being called ""Honey"": https://www.huffingtonpost.com/richard-schiffman/most-store-bought-honey-i_b_1118564.html

If you think that people don't really care about any of that, or the traceability of food, check out this Fast Company article: https://www.fastcompany.com/3063134/food-safety-track-and-trace-data

TL;DR of that article: not tracking food properly leads to disease, illness, or death. If you didn't know, those are bad for business. Once the public finds out, they vote with their dollars and stop spending money on those products.

4. Potentially revolutionizing/leading their niche

Let's be real, OT is creating the first fully blockchain agnostic supply side crypto. This means that any company can build on any blockchain. China can use NEO; Korea can use ICX; USA can use ETH, then there are a slew of others like IOTA, VEN, WTC, MOD, etc, plus an enterprise (like IBM with Walmart) can even build their own in-house blockchain and still use OT while also throwing out an award to OT for food safety innovation in the process (wink, wink). I can't state enough how massive this is. If OT is successful, you're going to see some major partnerships with other blockchains, huge supply chain enterprises, and of course little guys too that want to prove their product, such as a vineyard, against some global companies. It's what can give them an edge in the market to say, ""We know exactly where the fruit to this wine came from, and we can prove it with the simple scan of our GS1 standardaized barcode that pulls from the only GS1 compliant blockchain protocol (OriginTrail).""

5. Actual need for the token

This is pretty high on my list; I generally start with this one actually. If there isn't a need for the token, then I am not interested.

TRAC is crucial for the protocol to even function; without it, supply chains won't be able to send, store, and retrieve data. How will that happen? Nodes, duh! In a decentralized world, something has to be sending information and validating it; welcome to nodes on the OT protocol.

I'm highly interested in the node requirements, as well as the reward distribution; I can't wait for the node announcement in the next 30-90 days. If they find a financially happy medium for masternodes, or whatever staking mechanism they choose, look out, because people want those masternodes.

To quote the whitepaper directly:

""The Trace token is the means of compensation between supply chain data producers and data consumers on one side and the OriginTrail node holders on the other. It provides the incentive to the nodes in the peer to peer network to perform the system functionalities.""

Read section 4.6 of the whitepaper to learn more:https://origintrail.io/storage/documents/OriginTrail-White-Paper.pdf

I think this token is just like the early days of ICX, NEO, and the like. I don't know if it will ever be a top 25 coin. Hell, I don't know anything really.

However, with staking announcements coming in the next 30-90 days, testnet in June, mainnet in Q3, and a whole lot in between, I think TRAC has one of the best chances out of all of crypto to meet their goals and skyrocket in value in 2018.

"&gt; What I meant was that it places an added burden on anyone wanting to run their own full node, and thus can hinder people from utilising Bitcoin. I don't think the fact that bigger blocks lead to more centralisation can be debated.

It can very well be debated. But regardless of that, we know that crippling blocksize limits of the Bitcoin Legacy kind lead to reverse adoption (of that chain). That doesn't mean other ""cryptocurrencies"" do not get adopted. Sadly a lot of the coins that benefited from Bitcoin Legacy's reverse adoption are centrally controlled (such as Ripple, IOTA, etc.). In adition it lead Bitcoin Legacy adherents to believe LN is some kind of solution that will not be completely centralized. Both these things are much worse than any debatable centralization because of the questionable logic of not being able to run a full node. Both these things are complete cryptocurrency failure. Failure is not an option.

&gt; I'm not sure why you assume 10cents per transaction. 32mb blocks just means that there is just under 32mb block space available to anyone who's willing to pay a minimum fee.

Willing to pay a fee sufficient to cover the cost of including that transaction. Transaction cost is not zero, because blockspace has a marginal cost of production (orphan risk, storage, memory, processing, electricity, hardware, etc.). 

&gt; There's no reason the transfer fees would increase unless demand is such that it exceeds the available block space.

Currently the cost of producing blockspace minus the cost to find blocks (electricity, hashing hardware) is eclipsed by the block reward. The block reward completely masks that cost. This is not going to be the case anymore with a lot more transactions. If miners margin gets eaten away by the cost of including transactions, they're not going to include more transactions unless those transactions pay a higher fee sufficient to keep miners margin intact enough to be a profitable business.

&gt; There could easily be 30mb filled with social media posts every block, while still keeping the fees at the bare minimum.

It's my guess that if you actually had 30mb filled with transactions, that the cost of including transactions would exceed the block reward, and thus fees would more accurately reflect that cost.",1524246814

"&gt;Saying that BCH and BTC share the same mining infrastructure and therefore have equal levels of mining decentralization is simply not grounded in reality.


&gt;Would you extend that to say that all GPU mined altcoins have the same level of security and decentralization? 

Decentralisation mostly yes, security no.

&gt;That Ethereum and InfiniteCoin have networks on par with each other?

ETH is ASIC now, with likely one entity owning more than 51% of the hash rate like it happens to Monero some months ago.

By the very nature of PoW, there is no way to be sure.

&gt;What about NameCoin? Would you say that NameCoin , Bitcoin, and BCH have an equally decentralized pool of miners?

Yes,

And miner decide what they mine depending on profitability, BTC even mined BCH when it was profitable for them to do so, incentives.

&gt;You are deliberately ignoring the factual, observable evidence; that Bitcoin not only has 9x the hashrate of BCH; but that the diversity of miners and mining pools on Bitcoin is greater than BCH.

9x the hash rate doesn’t mean more decentralised.

It is a different thing.

&gt;This is directly observable

There is no way to know the real mining decentralisation.
If you think more pool mean more decentralisation, you are very naive, sorry.

&gt;BTC development is in no way centralized. 

Hahaa

&gt;The ""Core"" repository does have some centralization ; but they are the reference client because the ecosystem supports them. Nobody is forced to run core and there are many competing implementations 

But everybody is forced to follow the rules dictated by the core dev team..

Actually they use soft forks that will force your node to follow the chain even if you disagree with the upgrade.

Soft forks are coercive, no wonder it is the favorite core dev upgrade process.

&gt;; far more than for BCH. Again this is directly observable when looking at the diversity of protocol versions amongst nodes.

95% nodes are Bitcoin core nodes.

No other implementation is allowed bring anything to the table (remember B2X? A mere 2MB was the fucking end of the world)

&gt;I'm sick and tired of the twisted narrative that ""Core changed Bitcoin"" when the reality is that the Bitcoin ecosystem cumulatively REJECTED consensus breaking changes. BCH forked off Bitcoin because it made changes that the ecosystem mostly rejected.

Consensus never had a chance to happen in the first place.

Heavy censorship and social attack (and it continues today) prevented the discussion to take place and forced the “2 layer only” scaling on the community.

Now your only solution to scale is trough unproven tech.

Good luck with that.


&gt;If you want to ignore observable reality to push a narrative thats completely fine, but it only reinforces the feelings of the overwhelming majority of the ecosystem that BCH is not a competing altcoin; but an outright scam. 

Do you know what a scam mean?

Who get scammed here?

"&gt; There are multiple clients for BCH, so if miners don't agree with the changes, they can signal that. If users don't agree with the changes, the market value will speak for itself.  

Right. The same is true for any open\-source project. E.g. nearly all crypto projects including BTC. You can always fork and go your own way. Again: how does this make BCH special? 

&gt; So those OP codes were intended for currency uses. Since it's a scripting language, it's less complex and less prone to security exploits. 

As I said I agree with this in general. ""Payment only"" focused smart contracts could be a sweetsport for BCH. But there are other projects out there that are already doing \(or trying\) the same. Even projects that do that on top of ETH \(so while they remain beeing turing complete and decentralized they still enable security by providing simple to use payment focused libraries\). What makes BCH special on that topic? 

&gt; This is why there's a lot more tokens stolen through ETH apps. 

Alot of money is stolen in crypto in general. Because people don't know what they're doing or they're just lazy. I agree in general that complexity is the enemy of security but this doesn't mean that we should simplify everything to a point where it's as easy as putting a crayol in your nose.  Some topics are complex. Turing completeness can be a bitch. But if you want turing completeness that you can't just have ""all the good parts"" without the ""bad parts"". Complete freedom means possible complete failure.

I'm sure there is some truth to it, but I can't see that truth motivate giving value away.

A more reasonable explanation is that they want to FOMO people into HODLing BCH in order to increase the paper value of their own stashes, eventually forcing short-term-maximising-miners to mine for BCH instead of BTC.

12% of just the fees are very **very** low though, so it has almost zero practical impact today, aside from the media attention.

These clients communicate with chat servers to transfer messages to other clients.

It absolutely is cheaper to outsource tasks, and focus on what you're good at. But regarding blockchain, I haven't seen any data that shows whether or not adopting a cryptocurrency blockchain solution, is cheaper than building one. With adopting a public crypto comes the risk of value fluctuation in the underlying currency. That's a risk that's difficult to calculate, and hedge at this point in time. It might be a risk that some companies aren't open to exposing themselves to. Until we start seeing that data on those things, I can't say for sure which route is best suited. ",1524244474

"This works because they (bitmain) view fees as customers paying for something of value. If you want to troll on memo.cash you'd have to buy bch and spend it to a miner to troll. By burning the fees they ensure the value is payed back to the bitcoin cash holders and not someone who bought 10k sats just to troll and has no other investment in bitcoin cash. Also by burning 12% of fees (memo.cash is supposedly 12% of transactions now) they are paying back to investors the value created by the memo.cash app. Of course now it is very minimal value, but if you have a game plan you stick to it.",1524243626
"Person A deposits 100 Bitcoins with a bank trusting their security and insurance is more ideal than worrying about it themselves. 

The bank has analytics that suggest the average Person A will only ever dip into a small percent of their holdings at a time. So knowing that the bank takes a portion and loans 30 of it out to Person B. The bank bets that Person B will be able to pay back the loan with interest before Person A ever needs to be paid out 100 bitcoins all at once.  

And when Person A looks at their bank account the bank will still report their account is valued at 100 bitcoins even though the bank took part of the pile and lent it out.

"&gt; eth isn't immutable, which is a key difference. 

Besides the word of the BCH devs there is nothing \- particular no technology \- that would prevent this in BCH, correct? 

Besides: other blockchains \(tezos, for example\) want to handle this issue very elegant by having decentralized governance build in so even the Devs can't manipulate if the community doesn't allow it. 

BTW: you could argue that it's the same with BCH forks: if the devs decide to change the state using a hardfork the community could just decide to node update to that fork and thus you got some \- even if very basic \- kind of decentralized governance. BUT if you argue that way you have to accept that the very same is / was true for the ETH fork. The community decided.

&gt;BCH is a currency first, so its smart contracts are going to be currency based at first: multisig, escrow and timelock. 

Okay but that it's a currency is ""only"" in your mind. It's 1 and 0 first. What you use it for is up to the user. You COULD use ETH or any other crypto just in the same way. It is nothing technologly special to this. And there are PLANTY of escrow and timelock contracts for ETH / ETC and others already available. So again I don't understand why this makes BCH special.

&gt; Also ETH has an uncapped supply, which is a difference in economic opinion. 

While this is true ETH devs already suggested that this could change in future if needed / makes sense. Anyway no matter if it's changed or not it's just a mind thing as well. While I agree that price is opinion driven, so low caps result in higher value per token, this is really just a stupid fantasy of the market. It is real because people believe it is real but there is no technological reason why a asset with let's say 100 units in suply and 10 decimals has any more value then another asset with 10000 units and only 8 decimals. Yet I agree that per token BCH price, because of total supply AND decimals could be higher in future then ETH. But what's the point? If you get BCH as an investment only the possible growth is relevant. It's not relevant if you buy 2 BCH or 1 ETH for your 1000$ today.  And the most important driver for potential growth is technological advantage. Which is why I'm  for what will make BCH special in future.

&gt;Ethereum is also more complex and has security risks. 

While this is true and a more simple ""smart contract"" architecture which aims for cash transactions only could be a BCH sweet spot I would not compare this to Ethereum smart contract anymore. If it's not general purpose \- e.g. turing complete \- then it's limited compared to ETH and thus this should be clearly stated so. E.g. call it ""smart payment contracts"" or ""decentralized cash contracts"" or whatever. But you won't be able to run a decentralized application that aims to do more then just transfer money on such a system. With limited ""complexity"" and thus ""security risks"" comes limited field of application.

&gt;This is why you don't see a lot of apps on Ethereum 

Define ""a lot"". Also I'd say this is simply not true. Check [https://dappradar.com/](https://dappradar.com/) for example.

&gt;  So they have their own scaling issues to work out. 

Correct. But atleast I know there's a plan and a roadmap how to fix this issues there. That's why I'm asking for such a thing in BCH. Or do you believe the current scale is sustainable for the number of transactions that you'll see if BCH becomes #1 cryptocurrency AND #1 ""smart payment contract"" blockchain? ",1524243182

The reason I didn’t post on other subs is simple. r/Bitcoin is the largest, by far, and in my opinion Bitcoin Cash is still Bitcoin in the sense that FedEx Ground is still FedEx.

Thanks. Any idea where I can read up on the most revelant new news on crypto and BCH?,1524241388
"&gt; Also known as a ""protocol upgrade"". It has happened in bitcoinland before and will continue to happen. 

I'm aware of that. My point was that I was asking about what the future dev features that will make BCH stand out will be and the answer I get was ""blabla hardfork"". This is a typical phrase I read here which has no meaning at all. It only means ""there will be upgrades"", which is obvious. But I was asking about specific details what upgrades will be and how they make BCH special not only compared to BTC but to crypto in general. 

&gt; The evidence from Ethereum demonstrates your view to be incorrect. 

That is my exact point and why I say it's not special any longer. With Ethereum release they won and still hold the tokenization monopol. Just implementing the feature to have tokens on the chain is nothing special anymore. Every shitcoin does that by now. If you say ""tokenization is THE thing we need in BCH and it will be THE killer feature"" I'd like to know what will make THAT tokenization feature so special compared to ETH? The same is true for smart contracts.

&gt; Yet the most important question remains unanswered. 

Scale. How do you plan to have long sustainable scale while avoiding centralization \(which will happen once the full node database is bigger then avg. user storage\)

&gt; And the abundant objective, empirical evidence is what it is. 

The fact that there is no good plan I heared about how to solve the scale issue and no ""killer features"" on the roadmap that would make BCH special compared to other cryptos. Today your biggest competitor is no longer BTC. It's all other projects out there as well. IMHO the focus here is to BTC centric. If you compare BCH with shit you'll always be better. Yet this still doesn't make you good.

I'm not saying this to bash but because I hope that it will lead the Devs to develop an better product strategy.

&gt; Nope, downvotes for poor quality post that provides no value to the discussion. 

How so? The discussion is titled ""why you should surrender to BCH"". The tile is already hyped and shilling as hell. 

I'm providing arguments why I believe BCH has a long road ahead if it wants anyone to ""surrender"".  Maybe I bring no ""value"" to shilling. If that's the discussion then I agree. I'd think I provided more value to the discussion then most comments so far. To me value means ""make people think / rethink"".

**Bitcoin Cash**

Bitcoin Cash is a cryptocurrency and worldwide decentralized payment system that works without a central bank or government. In mid-2017, Bitcoin Cash split the main Bitcoin blockchain creating a diversion in blockchains. The change, called a hard fork, took effect on August 1, 2017. As a result, the bitcoin ledger called the blockchain and the cryptocurrency split in two.

"&gt;&gt;Nah, people prefer a good money when given a choice
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; No, they do not. You want to believe this is true, but it simply is not the case.

What makes you think so? 

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;&gt;If this wasn't the case already, cryptocurrency wouldn't have gotten off the ground at all.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Crypto 'got off the ground' because fiat is rotting

And a reasonable, rational person realizes that they don't want to lose value because of that, and thus bought crypto. Others may not have perceived that yet, but they will in time. Even the Venezuelans have figured it out.

&gt; like it has who knows how many times before. 

There was never a way out before that didn't have significant costs or entry limitations. Typically when economic downturn nears, the rich buy property, art, jewelry, and commodities that are likely to retain their value, or grow it, over time. The poor have a much harder time doing so and have much less capital they can spare for such things, but do you have any doubt that if they had easy ways out that they wouldn't do the same as the rich? I see no reason to automatically assume they wouldn't. People realize inflation is robbing them of purchasing power over time and that they don't want to save at negative-interest rates.

&gt; Fiat has collapsed around the world probably countless times, but due to the nature of the lifespan of the human and the sociopaths who rule over them fiat once again reigns supreme. It will collapse, and come back again.

That's the whole reason that bitcoin was created as a decentralized P2P app, because, as Satoshi said, governments seem to be unable to shut-down decentralized applications of this sort. That's why he created the blockchain, a decentralized ledger, that solves many problems at once.

You sound like you've given up hope on changing the world through crypto, that's hard to understand frankly, this experiment is very young and has thus far taken off incredibly! If BTC were still hovering at less than a dollar 10 years in, you'd have much more right to pessimism, but crypto has turned into a world-wide phenomena that EVERYONE is interested in! Recent poll in Britain, 50% of youths would rather invest in crypto than stocks.

The way movements occur is there's a leading edge that understands the technicals, and they engage early, serving as a signal to others. Others then begin doing the same, seeing the confidence placed in it by those who understand the technicals.

In our case, BTC Core devs kicked out the leading-edge and is trying to win with the 2nd-comers, because they're pretty easy to dupe. They hoped to scatter us and leave us wandering. But we're the leading edge in BCH now and people will see what we're doing, people ARE seeing it. Hell, just the last few days we went from an 11x multiple in price difference between the two coins to today's 7x. We have caught up significantly. And every time BTC surges I see price drop-offs soon after, but checking on BCH, I don't see the same price-drop-offs occuring. That's been happening for days. 

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;&gt;Any reasonable human being is going to choose B
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; There are not many 'reasonable' humans. 

Reasonable in this case simply means they don't want to lose money. That's everyone.

&gt; Democracy and fiat are dominant throughout 1st world countries. Look how fucking long it took humanity to recognize that the divine right of kinds was bullshit. 

We simply have to demonstrate another way is possible and that the results it produces are desirable, and the world will take notice and adopt that way of living because they want those same results.

Is this not the exact way that the world shed monarchy and adopted democracy?

We just need to do that a few more times, one in governance, and one in money, and the old world will be shed completely, giving birth to a new dawn for humanity which will mark the next thousand years of human experience. So let's build it! ",1524241088

"But what benefit does that offer? You can't just do it in house. That's just a database. You would need to run it across multiple nodes across multiple private organizations which means you need to assemble a community of private businesses, design, govern, and maintain the blockchain, as well as bring on developers and specialists to build the dApps. Why do all of that in house when there is a platform already designed to do this very thing? I think most people don't understand how specialized businesses are. If you are walmart or Apple, I could easily see them having their own blockchain and simply mandating that suppliers report on their blockchain if they want to work with them. They have the cash and the personnel to spare, and enough power over their suppliers to mandate almost whatever they want. But for most companies this doesn't really make sense. The best use of money for most companies is to specialize in whatever their profit centers are and let other companies do the rest. So BMW most likely doesn't want to spend money and personnel architecting and building out blockchains. They need to focus on building cars. 

You also have to think about cost. The per transaction cost will be slightly more expensive than doing it in house but how much do you save by not hiring blockchain developers, architects, strategists, running hardware, etc? Lots of companies have in house data centers. Even more companies use AWS and other cloud hosting. It's a classic in-house vs outsourcing decision.

 A sizable number of enterprise implementations end in either failure or unmaintainable systems. I work as a developer for an enterprise consulting company so I see this on a daily basis. Outsourcing to an existing product cuts time and risks dramatically. Adding a crypto token into the mix doesn't have to change the equation, nor does it mean the price will be exorbitant. Most customers can probably use the platform without ever touching the token and the price will be competitive to the alternatives. ",1524240769

"&gt; This is the problem. In fact, the problem is no one is sure. Other coins may rely on a PoW that is not fully understood. 

Huh? Hashing functions sometimes get broken, but for certain classes of algorithms we know for sure they will not be.

&gt; The stakes are too high.

You switched the argument from ""is it possible"" to ""is it feasible"" :) The parent claimed that it's impossible to have a PoW that does anything useful. I refuted that claim.

Whether Bitcoin should do that is a moot question, seeing how much time it took the community to increase the block size (btw was it increased after all? I stopped following the discussions after the first year :D )

&gt; NP-complete problem
&gt; Care to elaborate?

You can encode the hash of a block as a graph for the travelling salesman problem. The winning solution is a path that is shorter than an arbitrarily set number.

The difficulty would be either a size of the graph, or the limit of the distance. Finding solution for such problem requires an exponential amount of computations in relationship to the graph size, but verifying the validity of solution can be done instantly.

Obviously, you would need to make sure the graph generated is both useful, and unpredictable (i.e. so miners cannot modify blocks to generate easy to guess graphs), but this is still relatively easy.",1524240416
"I was referring to money being complicated, not Bitcoin. In many ways, crypto is simpler than fiat. If you want an eye opener, google “fractional reserve currency.” Money literally gets created out of thin air by banks, and it is just business as usual.

As for Bitcoin, there are a few much needed improvements before being able to have mainstream usage. Scalability is the obvious one, and we are hoping for Layer 2 solutions to solve that one soon. Other areas that will need addressed are simpler wallet UI’s and a rock solid approach to security that almost anyone can understand. If Bitcoin went mainstream today, theft and scams would be so common that people would be scared away from it. It would be WAY too easy to trick people into giving up their funds.",1524240391

"So explain how Bitmains absolute dominance of BTCs hashrate makes it the most decentralized. It may have the most resources committed to security, but by definition it's not decentralized when even the Bitcoin community agrees Bitmain likely controls more than 51%. 

The communities rationale is that Bitmain has no economic incentives to attack BTC with a 51% attack, but that's not the point. That means we are trusting a large entity to act in our best interests, the exact opposite of the point of BTC. Ripple also has no reason to attack it's own network but they say they wouldn't trust Ripple. Why trust Bitmain to not attack a network but not Ripple?

So since its not actually decentralized, it's a shitcoin right? I'm tired of hypocritical maximalists, somehow it's totally okay for Bitcoins hash rate to be dominated by Bitmain as long as they slowly lose their monopoly when Halong and Samsung begin mass production, but it's not okay for other coins to implement decentralization plans over time. Why? Why is ok for BTC to be centralized and become more decentralized over time but not for other coins?

Bitcoin is decentralized in name only. From a practical standpoint it's no different than any other, partially decentralized but with one company dominant that will hopefully lose dominance over time. There is one big difference, the companies of the other coins **want** to be more decentralized, Bitmain will fight tooth and nail to maintain their position.",1524240054

BTC is trying to push everything away from its on-chain heritage.  Every service on BTC will *have* to be completely redesigned and rewritten for LN (just as they decried these services for not implementing SegWit).

Bitcoin Cash is embracing the on-chain layer by strengthening it, and innovating on top of it.   This won't require any such massive rewrites from its service providers, except to take advantage of new capabilities at their own pace.

"&gt; what its limitations are, and that in fact does enforce very strong rules on individuals.

I do.  They are unimportant to the ideology.  We're talking about the general design of a system here, either centralized/top-down, or decentralized/bottom-up.

In a decentralized system the individuals do what they want, and the rules (functionality) of the system emerge naturally.  Like how your body works, with each individual cell having it's own design and approach to life, and the whole system naturally emerging as a human being (presuming you are one, which is probably likely!)  There are different genes, different expressions of those genes, in each individual, and the collective behavior is emergent humanity.

In a centralized system (also known as an artificial system) there is an attempt by one individual (or a small group) to force everyone in the system to behave in a particular way.  The individuals don't get to do what they want, and either are forced to be obedient or be kicked out (or otherwise punished).

Take a real life example: You meet with a group of friends to watch the (American) football game on a Sunday. You start talking about rugby, and insist on talking about rugby even after you've been told repeatedly not to, because is football Sunday. Are your friends really the assholes for kicking you out, or were you the asshole talking about rugby during a football meetup? 

If you tried to accuse your friends of ""censorship"", people would laugh in your face and tell you you're socially awkward and cannot fit in with the conversation. But somehow, online people think that normal (social) rules don't apply.

"4 years ago Bitcoin hitting $1000 was ridiculously unimaginable because we were viewing this from the perspective of what we knew about the market cap at that time... since then we have leaned that the Market Cap has grown tremendously as more people learn about crypto and gotten into it. If you believe in blockchain technology and it's use cases for problems that it solves in the world, once it attains mass adoption and is integrated in almost everything we do, the market cap today is going to be minuscule compared to what it will be then. We should not put up walls and boundaries limited by all we have experienced and currently know. This gives us tunnel vision and leaves us not very open minded to what this technology is going to do in the future. Market Cap hit $800B in Jan not very long ago. We still do not have mass adoption and it sits at $375B currently. The Crypto Market Cap will enter into the Trillions this year there is no doubt in my mind about that.",1524237979
"Constraints on 'On Chain'-

The world is pretty big in circumference. Meaning that confirming transactions will always require many confirmations that are slow. You can have 0 conf, but that removes the trust. You can use Nano style solutions, but that removes the trust that BTC has. Im unsure POS will work because of spammers, but still looks difficult to scale from physical limitations.

2nd layer might have to be the solution. People keep a few thousand/hundred dollars in their exchanges to spend, but keep their savings in cold storage.

Consider that moving billions of dollars is expensive, but BTC can do this for a hundred dollars WHEN the network is bogged down. This would cost millions in ancient times, and costs tens of thousands in modern times.

Blockspace has a marginal price of production which is not zero. Even without a fixed blockspace limit that does not mean miners are going to include a transaction that costs more to include than it pays in fees. The blockspace market will regulate the fee level.

Prior to BTC blocks bumping into the fixed size limit, miners didn't include just any transaction either. They always had some sort of limit internal to them beyond which they would not include a transaction.

"Paying transaction fees to get a social media post into a block isn't economic activity in the same sense as paying transaction fees to exchange Bitcoin. But arguments can be made that they're just as legitimate as the network does not and should not filter transactions based on what purpose they serve.

I think I can definitely quantify ""filling 32mb blocks with non\-transactional data for a sustained period of time"" as bad long term effects. It serves to hinder ""real"" economic activity as in exchange of value by demanding processing and storage of vast amounts of data that is in any case totally irrelevant to the actual network \(social media posts are irrelevant to anyone using BCH not for social media but to transfer BCH\).

I realize that once payments start requiring most of the block space they will be able to out\-pay other use cases. But right now there is no demand for block space to use for payments. Adding 130gb of social media posts every month until payment volume picks up would be a terrible thing imo.

Anyway, I think we'll have to agree to disagree.

Until the transaction broadcasts, it is in effect, a *potential* transaction.

"Saying that BCH and BTC share the same mining infrastructure and therefore have equal levels of mining decentralization is simply not grounded in reality.

Would you extend that to say that all GPU mined altcoins have the same level of security and decentralization? That Ethereum and InfiniteCoin have networks on par with each other?

What about NameCoin? Would you say that NameCoin , Bitcoin, and BCH have an equally decentralized pool of miners?

You are deliberately ignoring the factual, observable evidence; that Bitcoin not only has 9x the hashrate of BCH; but that the diversity of miners and mining pools on Bitcoin is greater than BCH. This is directly observable.

BTC development is in no way centralized. The ""Core"" repository does have some centralization ; but they are the reference client because the ecosystem supports them. Nobody is forced to run core and there are many competing implementations ; far more than for BCH. Again this is directly observable when looking at the diversity of protocol versions amongst nodes.

I'm sick and tired of the twisted narrative that ""Core changed Bitcoin"" when the reality is that the Bitcoin ecosystem cumulatively REJECTED consensus breaking changes. BCH forked off Bitcoin because it made changes that the ecosystem mostly rejected.

If you want to ignore observable reality to push a narrative thats completely fine, but it only reinforces the feelings of the overwhelming majority of the ecosystem that BCH is not a competing altcoin; but an outright scam. ",1524236539

If you can't articulate the specific attack, you're wasting your time.  What's the attack?

To answer your specific question, there's many ways to defend against ""spam-fill"" but even if we did none of that, miners are already incentivized to not do that, as it increases their costs, everyone's costs, increases the difficulty they have in keeping orphan rates low, and provides them no benefits.  The only thing they gain is that bitcoin becomes more valuable by not harming adoption with high fees.  Which is exactly what we want miners to want, and they do.

"Did you read the linked comment? I think it explains the point I'm making pretty well.  But here's another take on it:

&gt;Not only is a LN transactions *not* a ""Bitcoin transaction,"" it is in fact a Bitcoin IOU. Now it's a novel and potentially useful kind of IOU, an IOU with a different and potentially superior risk profile when compared to a traditional IOU, but, at the end of the day, still an IOU. To compare it to a traditional IOU, let's say you hand me an ounce of gold in exchange for a little piece of paper that says ""Roger Murdock agrees to pay to bearer on demand 1 ounce of gold."" One of the risks with this arrangement is obviously that when you show up with your IOU and ask for your gold back, I might not be able to give it to you because I simply don't have it anymore (e.g., maybe I lost it or traded it for booze or female companionship). ""But hey, with the LN, the other party can't (easily) run away with your funds because they're locked up in the payment channel."" Well, ok, great. The other risk with the traditional IOU is that even if I have the gold, I might refuse to hand it over when you present me with the IOU. ""But hey, with the LN, the 'IOU' is an unbroadcast Bitcoin transaction. All you have to do to ensure that it's honored is broadcast it to the network **and succeed in having it mined into a block in a timely manner.**"" Well, ok, but there's the rub, right? There are no guarantees that you'll be able to do that. 

More importantly, forget about the semantics of what constitutes an IOU.  The point is that a LN payment is a *necessarily imperfect substitute* for an actual on-chain Bitcoin payment. You might want to argue that it's a *better* substitute than what is available in traditional fully-custodial banking. But that's beside the point.",1524235849

"Cut/paste from reply to a heavily downvoted comment. Posting here for exposure.

....Why is BTC not the play right now? Because this bullrun is being fed by old investors, not new money. New money enters BTC.

Old investors are people who still want in, but were sitting in Tether waiting for the bottom. Or sold to fiat but left it on an exchange. They all want to time the floor. 

This money is coming back in now, but it doesn't come back into BTC, that's where new money goes. Some goes to BTC, but only what % of their portfolio they allocated to BTC. Say 10-50% typically. The rest is in alts. Notice that the average of 10-50% is around 30%. These numbers are made up, but used to illustrate the example. What's the actual number? It's probably not too far from 30% BTC.

So new money comes in, but 30% goes to BTC, 70% goes to alts.

Compare that to a new money FOMO bullrun phase (which will probably happen again at somepoint when we get near ATH again). This new money goes ""Coinbase -&gt; Buy BTC"". Maybe they buy some ETH. Maybe some LTC/BCH. But their first buys are ALL BTC. 

Their portfolios tend to be 90%+BTC, 10% mix of LTC/ETH/BCH. 

When that happens, BTC dominance increases, because all the new money is going into BTC, not alts. Sure, they'll start learning about alts, getting excited like we are, and move money to alts. That's when BTC dominance flattens out and starts to bleed out a bit and alt runs happen again.


But right now? This bullrun isn't fueled by new money. Not yet. It's old money that's just trying to get a piece of the floor. That's why I keep saying that even if you buy today, you are buying the floor. Because new money hasn't started back in yet. 

When they do, you want to be heavier in BTC. But right now? You want to be in whatever old money is buying, and they aren't buying BTC. They are buying their favorite ALTs.

That's why I'm only 10% BTC right now. When new money comes in, I'm going to try to get up to 50%+ BTC. Just not yet.",1524235506

I’m not saying it’s a good thing, just that I can imagine it became this way for practical reasons. I’m generally pro free speech, but sometimes it’s a necessary evil to censor certain people. I know many people here are very liberal and will not agree on that statement at all but I’ll give you an example: I am the co-owner of a clothing webstore and sometimes you get customers who order something, wear it to a party and then send it back with stains on it and reeking of smoke and sweat. We off course can not accept these returns as we can not sell these items to someone else. Some of these people get mad and post nasty things on our facebook page where they twist the truth and claim their return was rejected for no reason and we’re scamming them. In that case we delete the post and block the person, are we not right in doing this? Should we let potential new customers who read this false information be influenced by it? They can’t know what the truth is, but we do. We also spend a lot of money and time on great posts and ads on facebook and you’ll see other webstores promoting themselves under our post. Should we not delete and block those posts/users? Should we let them piggy back on our efforts?

You seem like a nice person, so I’ll believe you when you say your intention was not trolling. But if you really think every chain should appreciate the positive movement this new service offers, then why not post it on the general crypto sub? Did you also post it on the LTC, DASH, XMR, ETH, XRP, TRX etc subs? You probably have not.

"&gt;There's a big difference between IOUs and second layer transactions that are settled on the blockchain.

There isn't though. Second layer solutions like lightning network effectively do involve trading IOUs for Bitcoin. 

They are pretty well secured IOUs in that they require multiple signatures to transfer, but they are effectively IOUs for Bitcoin transactions, rather than Bitcoin transactions themselves.

Until they are written into the blockchain, they are only theoretical, *potential* Bitcoin transactions.

&gt;Gold was the best money the world had, ever. 

True. Arguably still is. That's how I use it, anyway.

&gt;In many ways, though, it makes sense to want to imitate gold, especially the characteristics that made gold the most tradeable good.

Sadly, BTC cannot and never will emulate the characteristics that makes gold the most traceable good. Those characteristics are:

1) The fact that gold is desired as a ""good"" in and of itself. Contrary to popular misconception, the demand for it is not arbitrary or based on ""faith"".

2) In addition to its demand as a ""good"" in its own right, gold also has unique *supply* characteristics that BTC cannot emulate. 

The cost to add to the supply of gold closely tracks real energy costs, and varying the degree of energy that is thrown at gold will vary the amount of new gold that is brought to market. Bitcoin mining simply does not mimic this important characteristic. The implications of this are profound and under-appreciated.",1524234937

The smaller (let's call it unreasonable) blocksize limit breaks the free blockspace market in Bitcoin legacy, because they have a situation in which no amount of demand (and hence fee level) can incentivize more blockspace to be supplied. Bitcoin Cash fixes this by alleviating the blocksize limit, and therefore it fixes the blockspace market (now demand can and will incentivize more blockspace supply). But a functioning blockspace market does not mean that miners will accept all transactions. They will only accept transactions that pay for their marginal cost of production.",1524234055

Man seriously, if there is one thing that people in crypto need to learn then they have to start being realistic.  

This 14days growth is not normal and to me personally it is holding longer than I thought it would.  I am expecting a 10% drop to happen within the next 7 days and that would be a normal thing after almost every alt coin moving up by 50%.

ProTip: Lock in profits when you can and move on and wait for a cheaper price. Do not buy coins, hold them and when the move up by 50% in 14 days, don't hope for another 50% in 14days.

YOu just can't do that in a bull market, because you dunk the price hard, but it just gets absolutely eaten up. Sure you liquidated longs, but good job, it cost you insanely to do so.

No, the play in a bull market is just to buy and hold, then pull back buying when you think we're getting overbought... then if we keep going into insane hype range, maybe start pulling profits slowly, then more, then more, then however much you want and are comfortable holding longterm - keep that.

Then buy back in on crashes.

That's my plan at least.

I don't think anyone is going to be successful liquidating longs in a bull market, just like nobody would have been successful liquidating shorts in the bear market. Imagine how that advice sounds... when the market is dumping, just put a MASSIVE market buy order in. BTC crashed from $20k to $8k, keep buying buying until you are biting into the $15k offers in the book. Sure, it's ONLY YOU, but don't worry you are liquidating shorts. You hero. Good job.

yeah, which will lower the security of the blockchain and therefore reduce the value of it.

&gt; network has already been proven to handle gigablocks

no it hasn't. generating bunch of large blocks in small low-saturation network is *not* proving that the system is sustainable in the wild, will withstand attacks and/or will not become centralized over time.

&gt; do you think Visa or MC run off Rasperry Pis

bitcoin was created to be different from Visa or MC. it was created with simple goal in mind - participation should not be cost-prohibitive:

&gt; What is needed is an electronic payment system based on cryptographic proof instead of trust, allowing any two willing parties to transact directly with each other without the need for a trusted third party.

""any two willing parties ... without the need for a trusted third party"". if full node can't run on commodity hardware you're forced to trust a third party.

&gt; 1 Sat per standard size 250 Byte transaction

this is not a thing, 1/Sat is *per byte* not per transaction and guess what, if you design your system to target specific fee to make it affordable for poorest segments of the population - spammers will just fill that space with their junk *and ""the unbanked"" will still have to pay higher fee*.

so i ask you again - what is the difference between your supposed ""malformed blocks"" that satoshi was trying to protect bitcoin from and the 250 bytes of transaction data? what is it in those malformed blocks and how do we tell it apart from valid transactions? you *have to* have a clear answer to this if you're holding such strong views about blockchain spam.

&gt; Some people live off less than $1 a day. How is BTC with its $1 - $40 fees going to help poor countries or bank the unbanked?

this is exactly the problem with spammers - they can afford to fill the blockchain, spending way more than ""the unbanked"". if you go for unlimited size blocks - this will lead to unstable and/or centralized network.

the solution is to protect the chain by making economically non-viable uses of it expensive through fees but also provide second layer solutions that can scale up independent of the chain but still retaining the security properties. it's mind boggling that anybody would oppose this just because it's a development from the ""wrong camp"".",1524233254

A sockpuppet is an online identity used for purposes of deception. The term, a reference to the manipulation of a simple hand puppet made from a sock, originally referred to a false identity assumed by a member of an Internet community who spoke to, or about, themselves while pretending to be another person.

The term now includes other misleading uses of online identities, such as those created to praise, defend or support a person or organization, to manipulate public opinion, or to circumvent a suspension or ban from a website. A significant difference between the use of a pseudonym and the creation of a sockpuppet is that the sockpuppet poses as an independent third-party unaffiliated with the puppeteer.

Furthermore, this is the most important thing to keep in mind when it comes to alts trading.

When btc had its bullrun up to 20k, the best thing one could do was stay in btc up until 20k and then go all in into altcoins because the ratio was so low that you got more alt coins with your btc stash.  

If you go in alts right now for a year hold, there is a chance that the ratio will go lower than what you have bought. So you might move up through the year but eventually when that btc run happens, people will sell their altcoins and the ratio will get rekt.  

If anything regarding a year hold advice, I'd tell people to go into the main coins (BTC, ETH at least), trade through the year with alts and increase your stash.
Wait until BTC run happens and I am pretty sure that BTC will lead the way in then next bullrun again.

Gold was the best money the world had, ever. What bitcoin promises is to take everything that made gold great and improve on it by making the coin itself transferable over a communications channel.

And everyone, this is why tethering is so dangerous... because the market doesn't just scream up, it slowly creeps up and leaves you questioning if you are doing the right thing? When you should ""FOMO"" in?... ""well, ""FOMO"" is for weak people"" and you are ""strong"", so you get left behind.

That's why it's SO MUCH SIMPLER to just never seal in losses by holding, and take advantage of pullbacks by buying in, in increasing amounts on the pullback. The ONLY time that strategy fails is when the asset goes to zero and stays there. So if you don't believe in crypto, don't do it, tether and short it, and good luck to you. If you believe in crypto longterm, this is the only foolproof play that has zero chance of losing longterm (provided that you never buy massively on a huge bubble pump). 

To avoid that, in times that the market rises too high above baseline growth and it looks like we're overbought, just do the opposite of the dip buying. On the dip, you buy in, in increasing amounts, the further you go. On the rise/bubble phase, you lower buys in increasing amounts, then move towards no motion, then move towards small sells, then slightly larger sells, then slightly larger sells, etc. It's impossible to time the market perfectly for sure... but that's why you do it in increments. That ""blends"" your exposure. 

Once you sell enough to play with house money, then you can just HODL forever. Maybe take a few grand out here and there. But just hold. I dunno, that's my plan at least, and it's working great. If I can survive the 85% pullback and be about 35% up right now, set up with a strong baseline position, then I think I'm looking good. If it pullsback and this actually is a bulltrap, then I just stick with the plan and expand the ground floor, so that when the real bullrun happens, I'm even better off.

Infact, long long longterm, with this strategy, I think I actually make out BETTER if this thing crashes further, so I can get more cheap buys. Since I'm not selling for at least 3, 4, 5, 10 years, the ONLY time that I want the price high is when I sell. I actually do better in the ""between"" phase if we stay lower longer.

"Some musings...

Why are the alts on a bull run instead of BTC?

Part of me wonders if the most recent push by the community to call on the exchanges to add FIAT pairs to most alts and decouple from BTC, is actually working. We have had announcements by Binance and Bittrex that they will both be adding them soon. Gemini, Fair-X, and more as well. Could it be that we finally got what we wanted?

What if that isn't the case. Remember Mt' Gox and that moron Kobayashi? Well, he is still out there. So is the remaining 1.5 billion in BTC and BCH that needs to be disposed of. Are people avoiding pushing BTC up again because of this? Will BTC just stabilize between 7-10k to avoid giving this guy another prime chance to crash it? Obviously, he could still cash out low (with the court's permission), but I doubt it.

What if that has nothing to do with it either, and this is a huge coordinated effort by the ultra rich? What if the whales were stocking up on Alts during Feb - April instead of BTC? What if alts are going up first so the whales can take quick profits before dumping them all into BTC, and causing another Alt crash / BTC moon?

Or, have the alts finally matured enough to stand on their own against BTC? Are people finally investing in the promising projects of the future, and not trying to make a quick buck on the next moon?

This is a real head scratcher...

"&gt;Using the same Proof of Work doesn't mean you have the same level of decentralization. 

It is.

The same pools of miner are divided between the two chain.

&gt;Look at the actual data provided. You can look at it over any time scale and you can see there is more diversity of miners working on the Bitcoin chain than BCH.

There is no way to know mining diversity.

For all we know both BCH and BTC can be mined by the same mining farm spreading hash power among all pool.

All we can be said is both chain share the same mining infrastructure.


&gt;There is one reference client because collectively Bitcoin holders, miners, exchanges, etc agree with the direction in which the ""Core"" client is being developed. 

And because any attempt of decentralised development is meant with threat of splitting the currency (B2X).

Bitcoin dev is higly centralised and rely on one single person validation. (Lead maintainer Vladimir)

&gt;As BCH has proven anyone is free to fork off ;

“Forced” to fork off after year of trying to compromise.

&gt;and everyone is free to dump one fork for the other. If the Bitcoin Ecosystem agreed more with BCH than BTC it would have jumped ship. 

Heavy censorship and manipulation prevented the market to freely decide.

&gt;The definition is collectively decided by the ecosystem. ""Core"" has no control other than the voluntary consent of those in the ecosystem running the core software and building off it. 

And threats..

&gt;If ""Core"" tried to implement a change the ecosystem disagreed with ; like removing the 21M coin limit ; I can guarantee that the ""Core Client"" would not be considered the reference client in very short order.

Then why a complete change of economics characteristics and incentives is ok?

So using threats and manipulation to change Bitcoin is ok as long as you are ok with the change? Well I hope you will be ok with whatever further tweaking the Core dev will do.. otherwise get prepared to be silenced and banned.


&gt;This sort of nonsense ""rebuttal"" is exactly why most Bitcoin holders dumped their BCH. There is no actual attempt to debate the facts, data, or issues; but and endless supply of people to tell you you're wrong and offer long winded responses that avoid actually responding to any points other than to say ""Nuh uh""

It is not about debating data after the fact...

It is about recovering original bitcoin characteristics.

&gt;Pretending that BCH is as decentralized as BTC even when the data demonstrates that not to be the case is either misunderstanding or intentional falsehood.

It is your claim, not mine.

And so fair you failed to demonstrate it.

* BTC got strongly centralised dev team, everyone/everything that disagrees with them is an attack.
* BTC got less nodes per market (30% less...),
* BTC got the same mining infrastructure as BCH but BTC punishes small miner with high network fee (they disproportionately affect small miner, meaning that for the same profitability small miner will prefer mining BCH).

&gt;Being honest about the situation will allow the BCH community to address the issues of centralization ; 

Growth will take care of decentralisation, I personally don’t worry about that.

It is not in BCH culture to use threats and social attack to achieve its goal, either decentralisation come organically or the system is broken.

"&gt; nobody is setting transaction fees. 

The wallets set the minimum and standard fees e.g. bitcoin.com wallet does 1 Sat/B. However it's currently up to the individual miners on what minimum fee they will accept to include a transaction in a block. With plenty of block space there's no reason to not include any transactions. Any miner not accepting a transaction loses the fee to any miner who will include it. That's the incentive to include as many as possible. High fees on Segwitcoin kill commerce, microtransactions and a lot of use cases. This is why Bitcoin has been losing considerable market share to altcoins the past few years.

&gt; no, security doesn't stay ""relatively the same"". miners dropping out means hasrate going down means security (cost of attack) going down.

Yes it does because you need to think about why the miners might drop off. In which case a halving might have recently happened and the relative fiat price hasn't risen to a level that is sustainable to maintain profitability yet. Miners can of course rejoin at any time if it does become profitable. If miners drop off the difficulty adjusts downward and the other miners remain profitable. When you talk about ""security"" that's irrelevant because it will remain relatively the same security if any attacking miner can't affordably attack the network. Hash rate leaves due to no profitability, an attacker will find it just as unprofitable to attack at the same time.

&gt; in less than two years reward will be 6BTC. four years from that - 3BTC. before 2030 reward will be 1.5BTC. sure, some of the loss will be offset by price increase, but low rewards are not decades away. asset depreciation is a thing, what do you think is a profitable lifetime of a mining rig?

At each of these halvings there is likely to be a large uptick in fiat price to compensate because there's less coins being mined, hence less inflation and hence less coins available for selling in the market. Even if 95% of the miners left in 10 years time the network would keep running as the difficulty adjustment would compensate to make it easier to mine for remaining miners. They might find with 1 BCH per block and a price of $100,000 per BCH it's still profitable to mine on their cheap solar powered mining rigs. When the block reward completely runs out then the network would rely on transaction fees from millions of transactions per block.

&gt; and this is the critical point. network efficiency, stability and participation cost all depend on how much volume is allowed. block size was limited precisely because the danger of overwhelming the network with spam, what makes you think this danger is behind us?

The network has already been proven to handle gigablocks with nodes just needing a medium sized server. I ask you, do you think Visa or MC run off Rasperry Pis? No they have datacenters full of servers and that's just for one small country. I've worked designing the server/network infrastructure for banks.

&amp;nbsp;

A message for the noobs, who might get confused by this and other similar posts. r/bitcoin is EXTREMELY welcoming to **everyone**, but it DOES ENFORCE STRICT RULES. One such rule is

* r/bitcoin is a sub to discuss Bitcoin, not altcoins

In this respect, Bitcoin Cash managed to get a special spot within the moderation policy - There's basically a *zero* tolerance policy towards it. You may disagree with it, but that's the way it is. If you don't agree with the rules, you don't join the group. 

Altcoin conversations do no belong on r/bitcoin, simple.

&amp;nbsp;

When the rules are clear, every cry of ""censorship"" is misguided. I have myself, in the past, had posts removed because they were about altcoins. Guess what, I'm **absolutely fine** with it. I got the message, and leave my altcoin discussions out of it. My posts are not removed anymore.

Let's say you join a Tekken-dedicated group, with the explicit rule that only Tekken-related discussion is accepted. I hope you wouldn't be surprised if you get kicked out after you start conversations about how great Street Fighter is. That's not censorship, that's enforcing rules.

Yes because the first approach to frypto usually is Bitcoin and for reddit that means r/bitcoin

&gt; It takes a lot of time and research to realize that BTC no longer aligns with the p2p cash vision / ideal and maybe many do not even know about the p2p cash vision.
Yes this was the biggest point for me. And when it first happens I was like ""but no, why would so less ppl know about this then and why is this not more public etc"" Its probably normal human first moment behaviour if you realize you thought wrong in the past.

&gt; It is hard to know who is telling the truth when technical arguments are made because it takes time and effort to understand the technology enough.
Yes!!! Absolutly and I would lie if I d say I fully understood it now. But fe. just the shady practices they use gives me a bad feeling and makes my inner alarms tingeling...

&gt; It is hard to see that rBitcoin is under heavy censorship.
Yes!! Because as mentioned its usually the first approach for a newcomer and the slight but ongoing bash against bch and r/btc somehow gives you this weird mindset. The whole ""hodl and get rich"" mentality that really screamed greed in a ugly way made me more sceptical on the r/bitcoin subreddit and pushed me further into other ressources for research..

&gt; For people focused more on gains, many are looking at the surface price and not the fundamentals.
I guess so. But tbh I dont think you really can get a lot from them. Even if they see the issue, Im not sure if they would change anything (if they dont see their money/invests in danger). I would lie if I d say the big numbers have not attracted me at all, but its clearly not the main part!!

"Blockspace is a commodity produced by miners and consumed by users (most often for the purpose of economic activity). Blockspace has a production cost (electricity, hardware, orphan risk, storage, processing and network bandwidth).

The reason fees for transactions are extremely high (at times) on Bitcoin Legacy is because they have an artificial blocksize limit. The reason they are extremely low on Bitcoin Cash is because this artificial limit has been removed. The transaction related costs of blockspace production (orphan risk, storage, processing and network bandwidth) for the present amount of transactions is currently negligible in Bitcoin Cash.

But when the transaction count rises, these transaction related costs will rise and there will be a level beyond which miners will not include more transactions into a block. This is because the cost of including the next transaction is higher than the fee of the transaction. This means fees will have to rise if you want to include more transactions. It will reach a balance between supply of and demand for blockspace and the fee will reflect that balance.

Multiple use-cases compete for blockspace. Some use-cases have more capacity to absorb fees (such as payment) and others have less capacity to absorb fees (commenting on social media). That means that when fee competition does arise due to blocks reaching the limits of willingness of miners to include more transactions, that some use-cases with less capacity to absorb fees will be priced out.

If you assume the current fee-regime of very little or no fees will persist in the face of adoption of use-cases with more fee absorption capacity and build an application (such as memo) based on that assumption, you are going to be in for disappointment in the future.",1524228884

Why are the alts on a bull run instead of BTC?  

Part of me wonders if the most recent push by the community to call on the exchanges to add FIAT pairs to most alts and decouple from BTC, is actually working.  We have had announcements by Binance and Bittrex that they will both be adding them soon.  Gemini, Fair-X, and more as well.  Could it be that we finally got what we wanted?

What if that isn't the case.  Remember Mt' Gox and that moron Kobayashi? Well, he is still out there.  So is the remaining 1.5 billion in BTC and BCH that needs to be disposed of.  Are people avoiding pushing BTC up again because of this?  Will BTC just stabilize between 7-10k to avoid giving this guy another prime chance to crash it?  Obviously, he could still cash out low (with the court's permission), but I doubt it.

What if that has nothing to do with it either, and this is a huge coordinated effort by the ultra rich?  What if the whales were stocking up on Alts during Feb - April instead of BTC?  What if alts are going up first so the whales can take quick profits before dumping them all into BTC, and causing another Alt crash / BTC moon?  

Or, have the alts finally matured enough to stand on their own against BTC?  Are people finally investing in the promising projects of the future, and not trying to make a quick buck on the next moon?

Lets say we get a bull run around 4 times market cap from now, around 1,5 Trillion $, evenly distributed (for ease of calculating):

Last BTC ATH was 20k (MC around 0,8 T$), so that is our main spot, I would definitive secure a part of profits here (a little before (18-19k$ BTC, maybe 25%-30% of my whole portfolio), since this event will be a huge the catalyst, IF this line is reached, all shit will break loose, BTC all over the media, and every fucker in the world will want to go with the hype again. why 30% before the 20k line? I guess a lot of ppl will want to recoup their looses, this way we can either reinvest, or have a nice profit to minimize our exposure. 

After that, our aim is 1,5 T$ as mentioned, which means a BTC price of somewhere around 30-50k$ depending on the dominance (around 35% maybe??). Now comes your portfolio in play, altcoin allocation, and how much your altcoins have over/under performed BTC. I would start amassing Alts around a BTC price of 25k (BTC to alt switch) to get ready for an altrun (if it hasn't happened in the meantime), and look to gradually take profits on alts, everywhere where they outperformed BTC for more than +200% (this is a personal value, depending on the coin, tech, future goals, performance etc.). 

this is just a rough plan that I am building for now, still a lot to to do and get my numbers straight with my wishes. Better do that now, since whene FOMO and HYPE start again, we have seen what happens.

"I'm actually also invested in sub!

But as for prl I can most definitely try :) Keep in mind i still have a few pending questions regarding it and may be slightly off with a thing here or there.

To start, I've bought and sold prl at least 3 times now. I keep going back because there is *something* about that low cap coin that draws me to it - but one reason I'm sure of is that the head of oyster, Bruno, is smart as actual fuck. The team aren't some randoms trying to get in on this crypto fad for no reason. They're building things that sound so complicated yet the way they explain it on their whitepaper (and how they respond to people with questions on reddit/telegram/etc) gives you that lightbulb in your head like ""hmm wow, that actually makes a lot of damn sense"". You may understand what I'm getting at, but long story short they really thought things through. 


Prl is an erc20 that uses iotas tangle. It's main purpose is to be a decentralized storage. Website owners can include a line of code on their site and everytime someone visits the site, they give up a small amount of power and that power goes to mining pearls. The website owners can either hold PRL and use it to store their own data or just sell it for a quick buck. A quick side note,  prl mining can be used in addition to running google ads so theyll just be getting extra revenue at almost no effort. 

1 PRL will buy you x amount of data on their platform. Prl is the first of its kind to be pegged to a certain amount of data. I believe 1 PRL will be pegged to 64gb data storage (which is roughly $8 if you choose to go elsewhere). Once everything is up and running, imagine prl still being at around $1. Do you really think big companies or anyone for that matter is going to overlook such a cheap way to store data privately? This will in turn increase the price and it'll continue to go up and down in cycles until it stabilizes to a pegged price.

But at that point, why should anyone continue to gold prl? Well, they've addressed this and said that they will consider *increasing* the amount of gb 1 PRL is pegged too. 


They also just airdropped a new project SHL (oyster shell) which is the first crypto to try and develop a wireless meshnet that provides low-cost **internet** instead of data. People say it's been attempted a thousand times before but never has it been attempted with blockchain technology (which if you think about it is almost perfect for such a thing).


I'm bullish on these guys and for being such a low cap I personally see no reason to throw some money in them. It feels like one of the better low caps imo and Prl mainnet launch is this month (aka these next 2 weeks).",1524225667

No I never claimed any of this. I said more people are *using* BTC than BCH. That has no bearing on the question of how many people *own* BTC versus BCH.

"&gt; I believe there already sites that do peer to peer bitcoin lending and coins that will do this. Take a look at most of the exchanges that do margin trading. Margin traders borrow money from other users to make those trades. This is also the future of smart contracts.


Which is just begging for fraud. (And fraud is one of the reasons smart contracts will _never_ be able to do lending by themselves.) Also, margin trading is not a fair comparison; It is essentially risk-free for the exchange so long as the liquidate offers before they go underwater.

But that's not the real problem. The real problem is that borrowing commodity currencies is _expensive_, doubly so for deflationary ones.

For one, the currency your loan is denominated in is deflating; The amount the lender has to pay back, in terms of value (i.e. hours worked/goods purchased equivalent) increases over time. 

On top of that, the lender has to compete with saving; Which pushes up interest rates.

Sure, loans will not seize existing, it's not like banks are physically incapable of handing out cryptocurrency instead of conventional currencies.

But, the increasing cost of loans will massively decrease the availability of credit. _And this is terrible for the economy._ As sja28 points out, _people need loans to buy houses. Or to pay for education. Or to start businesses._",1524225367

"The blockchain is trustless, not the exchanges. The exchanges are a speculation machine, not part of the tech. Not to say that trustless decentralied exchanges couldn't exist.

Talking of stolen bitcoin in exchanges is like talking (about the security of the banks and) of your neighbour coming in your home and stealing you cash. It's irrelevant, it says nothing about the blockchain.

The only valid way to buy and exchange bitcoin is peer to peer, any other is not part of the tech as it goes out of the blockchain into the servers of a 3rd party. Thing is there *is* a way, if you use it or not is all on you.

The software is open source and easy to set up in a toy/test configuration to check it for yourself. There is nothing in it that cannot be scrutinised and doesn't really belong to anyone.

BTW you never need to trust a 3rd party to exchange your coins. I use bitcoin to buy things (every now and then) and do it directly via exchanging bitcoin from my wallet to the vendor's and then attaching the transaction ID to a message that I send to the vendor

It's about storage and transaction of data/wealth in a manner that is foulproof. That has never done before and to the extend that is truly foulproof it's probably one of the greatest inventions of the 21st century.

Imagine how much wealth would be unlocked merely by the act that neither the data's storage nor its transaction can be tampered with. The value of such a proposition is immense, at least several trillions in today's valuations, hence the rife speculation.

Of course it can all go to zero if a reliable and relatively cheap way is found to tamper with it (for example there is the 51%, but no cheap exists to initiate it , currently, giving dicincentive to a potential attacker, if anything you can actually make it even harder to the attacker, as the network grows)",1524225141

"Using the same Proof of Work doesn't mean you have the same level of decentralization. Look at the actual data provided. You can look at it over any time scale and you can see there is more diversity of miners working on the Bitcoin chain than BCH.

There is one reference client because collectively Bitcoin holders, miners, exchanges, etc agree with the direction in which the ""Core"" client is being developed. As BCH has proven anyone is free to fork off ; and everyone is free to dump one fork for the other. If the Bitcoin Ecosystem agreed more with BCH than BTC it would have jumped ship. 

There is one reference client and many non reference clients. The definition is collectively decided by the ecosystem. ""Core"" has no control other than the voluntary consent of those in the ecosystem running the core software and building off it. If ""Core"" tried to implement a change the ecosystem disagreed with ; like removing the 21M coin limit ; I can guarantee that the ""Core Client"" would not be considered the reference client in very short order.


You are literally ignoring the data and handwaving. 

This sort of nonsense ""rebuttal"" is exactly why most Bitcoin holders dumped their BCH. There is no actual attempt to debate the facts, data, or issues; but and endless supply of people to tell you you're wrong and offer long winded responses that avoid actually responding to any points other than to say ""Nuh uh""

Pretending that BCH is as decentralized as BTC even when the data demonstrates that not to be the case is either misunderstanding or intentional falsehood. Being honest about the situation will allow the BCH community to address the issues of centralization ; but by handwaving it away as a nonissue will not improve in this regard.

You have to make a lot of untested assumptions for this to be true.

A lot of people thought Bitcoin could scale onchain until they realized just increasing block size wasn't a viable option. Blocksize only got reduced to 1mb reactively, Satoshi had no idea it would be necessary before it happened.

For Lightning to work at scale you need to assume that it can grow to a point where you never need to open or close a channel without ever requiring more blockspace than is economically feasible, which is a huge assumption.

you also need to make an assumption about the reliability of routing at the scale of billions, which is completely untested, especially with a financial component.",1524223835

"&gt;Nodes per user is not a measure of decentralization. If I start my own fork and run 4 nodes and I'm the only user that doesn't make my chain more decentralized because it has 4 nodes per user.

First of all, I don't think nodes do much of anything for decentralization; but is your claim that raw node count is what makes a currency more decentralized? That seems prima facie false. If all BTC nodes were owned by a single user and all BCH nodes were owned by unique users, which currency is more decentralized? Intuitively I would say BCH.

&gt;If your assumption is true; that BCH only has 20% of the users as BTC that means all BCH is controlled by 20% of the people as BTC. That would clearly indicate that distribution of BCH is more centralized than BTC.

I was calling people ""users"" if they transact on the blockchain. BTC has more than 5 times the economic activity that BCH does but only 5 times more nodes than BCH according to your metrics. That means in proportion to the economic activity going on, BCH has a lot more eyes on the blockchain than BTC. ",1524223677

"You say none of the major retailers were disrupted, but thats inaccurate, look at these to name a very few affected by lack of adaptation:

Toys R Us, a massive UK toy retailer, 1980s to 2017, bankrupted due to store ownership overheads crucifying their profits in an online retail world.

Kodak, photo films and cameras, started in 1888, held the largest market share for photography in the 80s and filed for bankruptcy in 2012. Didn't adapt to a world with smartphones and digital cameras.

Blockbusters, video and game rentals, 1985 - 2010, Over 9000 stores at it's peak, didn't keep up with the online streaming services. Filed for bankruptcy.

The list does go on, and gives us an understanding that if you don't adapt (and as you say, use that new outlet effectively) then you die. end of.

This applies to banks too, they operate in a commercial environment on the majority, if they dont adopt blockchain and crypto, then their competitors will get ahead of them.

Governments are no different in the fact that they need to adapt and have competition in other governments. They all need money to grease the countries' wheels. Look at the UK, after making such a poor decision of brexit (had to slip that in), realise that adopting blockchain technology could help counter some trade impacts. Quote from chancellor Phillip Hammond about crypto - “I am committed to helping the sector grow and flourish, and our ambitious sector strategy sets out how we will ensure the UK remains at the cutting edge of the digital revolution... As part of that, a new task force will help the UK to manage the risks around cryptoassets, as well as harnessing the potential benefits of the underlying technology.”

I think if ppl go deeper into other fields for research and have open questions or ask for something on a post we can link the comment from singularity. I dont remember exact where it was, but I do remember the user actually was really frustrated and just mentioned the comment in a sidenote, but it had a huge impact on me when I look back now.

I will look out for ppl who are looking for more informations or ask questions. I think its possible to have a common sense one day that r/bitcoin is censored and what their values are now. I also think still a lot of ppl will stay there but its probavly like with the facebook data issue: nobody can say now they dont know about it. They do, but maybe dont care. Lets find the ones that dont know yet, but would care. For myself, I think its the best to be active in my smaller communities where ppl ""know"" me and are ok to click the link and read for 5minutes.",1524222782

"Please read the following very carefully.

Blockspace is a commodity produced by miners and consumed by users (most often for the purpose of economic activity). Blockspace has a production cost (electricity, hardware, orphan risk, storage, processing and network bandwidth).

The reason fees for transactions are extremely high (at times) on Bitcoin Legacy is because they have an artificial blocksize limit. The reason they are extremely low on Bitcoin Cash is because this artificial limit has been lifted.

However that does not mean there do not exist some (softer) limits to the blocksize. The reason transaction fees are so extremely low currently in Bitcoin Cash is because the transaction related costs of blockspace production (orphan risk, storage, processing and network bandwidth) is very small.

When those soft limits with current technology are reached, the price for the commodity of blockspace (the fees) **will rise** until a balance between supply and demand is established.

This fee rise will price out lower value use-cases from using blockspace. Some usecases such as economic activity are willing to absorb fairly high fees, while other usecases (such as commenting on social media) will not.

If you build a lower-value use-case with on-chain storage expecting that the current extremely low fee level will persist forever, you will encounter substantial problems once higher-value use-cases see more adoption.

Fees for bitcoin are very low now, but look at daily transactions. There's plenty of empty blockspace now and no demand for it (hence low fees).

"I just joined this community about 6 months ago and it blows my mind to think about how many people still have zero idea or interest in crypto still! 

There are some VERY intelligent and RICH people who haven’t even read the definition of Cryptocurrency yet. Haven’t even looked into BTC. 

Don’t you see?

The dreamers and the visionaries are always first involved and the most passionate, but they dont always have the most $$$. 

The biggest bags will come when they are confident they can make 5-10% minimum per year with little downside risk and market history long enough that they can assume every bear will result in a future bull.  

Cryptocurrencies are volatile in comparison to traditional stocks. This is what the old rich men know and trust. 

As years go on there will be more data and more natural trust involved. 

Think about it, if you were investing 100,000,000 a 5% gain per year means you are profiting $5,000,000. 

You dont need to risk volatility and losing your initial investment because your sheer volume of cash alone can make you more money then you need. 

If i had $100,000,000 and was unsure of when i was going to die and didn’t want to risk my kids inheritence, i wouldn’t get involved in cryptocurrency RIGHT NOW.

I would wait until it gets more predictable, has 20+ years of market history, and slower trends of steady % gains year after year.

This WILL happen eventually in cryptocurrency with Top 10 Coins i believe. 

I think we are the early adopters and will benefit most from being involved in cryptocurrencies. 

But once it becomes very normal for majority of people to hold and use cryptocurrencies, gigantic bags will continue to naturally pour into this market and continue to grow and increase adoption.

Shilling aside, you should probably start by buying something relatively safe. Relatively. As in, some coins in the top 10-20. And even in that span there are some shitcoins that won't go anywhere, most likely. 

But Ether, Bitcoin Cash, Stellar, NEO, Monero are a few that are probably fairly uncontroversial to buy. Wanchain, also, looks good. Of those I personally only hold Ether at the moment, but I can see arguments for the others doing ok too. 

But don't rush in like a dork and buy at random. Actually figure out what you're buying, why you're buying it and what your idea of a return percentage looks like - as well as in what timeframe you want that money to appear.",1524220802

Over the last quarter ELTCOIN has had a drop in trading volume and a knock-on reduction in liquidity. This quickly stabilised and the ELTCOIN team has been working hard to list on larger exchanges to boost volume and provide the ELT Community with greater liquidity.

We’re excited to announce that the the ELTCOIN team is currently finalising the commercials of a formal offer from a top tier exchange for BTC/ELT and ETH/ELT trading pairs. The exchange has over $250,000,000 of daily volume and is consistently ranked in the global top 10 of exchanges by volume.

Unfortunately we cannot confirm their name until we are publicly listed due to legal reasons, however the ELTCOIN team is confident as the commercials of the listing agreement are excellent and we are looking to progress to finalisation of the listing process.""

"Here's a little post I made awhile back on exactly this subject.

On quantum computing vs blockchains:

Quantum computers(QC's) are very good at some operations and very bad at others. Both ethash (Ethereum's PoW algo) and hashcash (Bitcoin's PoW algo) fall into the 'very bad at' category.

Our best QC right now is 10 qubit. A 4.4mn qubit QC could achieve about 14 gigahashes on the BTC chain. Current BTC mining ASIC's can achieve 1.4 terahashes - or about 1000x more.

So it's not practical to attack the network w/ a 51% attack.

The other possibility would be the 'break the encryption' attack.

QC's will be great at breaking logarithm and factoring based encryption like Diffie-Hellman, but bad against NP-Complete hash functions and AES. (More on that here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NP-completeness)

The exact of this is that QC's are no faster than modern machines at finding preimages used in hash functions.

Ethereum uses merkle trees (hash trees) - hashed SHA3. This makes it extremely resistent to encryption attacks from QC's.",1524220471

Our Income Tax Act is designed to not be easily taken advantage of. Just my 2 satoshis. That said, I may be wrong as I took the tax course awhile back.

"Glad you mentioned that. Here is a quote from a article posted on 17.Nov.2018:

""So total consumption for banks during a year only on those three metrics is around (I am rounding) 26Twh on servers, 58Twh on branches and 13Twh on ATMs for a total of close to a 100 Twh a year.

According to the article that trigger this discussion, Bitcoin annual Twh consumption is 28.67 , so currently more than 3 times more efficient than a very conservative calculation of the cost of the global banking system.""

After he did some calculations, which I know are not that correct, but as you can see he counted ATM's too. Now this is a old article, Bitcoin has reached 61.4 THh, which doubled in a period of 4 months. Who knows how much more will be added to this network and yet we are no where near adoption, so Visa is still doing a good job right now.",1524219683

"BCore are the ones misrepresenting here.

By implying that BCH is not Bitcoin they are deliberately creating the impression that some guys came along, created a new coin altogether and called it Bitcoin Cash and 'stole' their brand.

When in reality, Bitcoin cash came from Bitcoin. It is Bitcoin. It has the same genesis block.  The creators were from the Bitcoin community and many of them were involved before Blockstream took control. BCH has more Bitcoin qualities than BTC, refer to Satoshi's white paper if in doubt.

"I don't know, I think it'll have the opposite effect - people bought ETH or BTC to then buy XRP or ADA or whatever.  

That's two times the volume for one objective. If people will just buy and hold what they want, that's half the volume.  

The only variable in this is how many more people will be attracted by the simplicity of it. Binance is great for new users when it's up and running, so it'll be like.. Boom, sign up, boom, buy Cardano with Euros. Easy. That will attract more people. But I expect Volume to go down.",1524219385

"Just remember that you're about to enter the most unregulated, volatile, speculative and predatory market ever conceived where experienced players enjoy seal clubbing the noobs, exchanges are known for shady moves that sometimes make banks look like beacons of morality and the market will often be too irrational for its own good. Everyone will want to shill you their coins, every sub dedicated to particular currency is heavily populated with shills and sock puppets that will fight any critique to the death and nobody knows what the price will be tommorow no matter what everyone says. 

The most important lesson is don't trust anyone and by anyone I mean fucking anyone. Do your own research and think for yourself. If someone hands you over free information ask yourself why they're sharing it and be vigilant, crypto space is populated with a lot of unsavory people of all kinds.",1524219334
"But you _have_ realised your gain when you traded your BTC for the ETH. At that point in time, you decided: BTC has been good to me, has gone up 100%, but I now think ETH has more potential, so I'll move my money there. That's the exact same reasoning/procedure that happens with most stock trades. When you decided to move your money, you realised your BTC gains, you just chose to immediately reinvest them in something else.

&gt; You now owe taxation more than your portfolio is worth based on that BS realised gain.

If the financial year isn't over yet, you can sell that ETH, and you'll owe no taxes (since you now have a total realised 20% loss).

Remember back in late December, when we had a bit of a dip, people were going around saying: oh, it's just investors selling for tax reasons. Not enough of them asked themselves: I'm an investor, is this something I should be doing too, maybe?

Investors know to assess their tax liabilities at the end of a financial year, and sell enough of their holdings to cover what they will owe. Some brokers will remind/warn their customers that this is something they should do. Crypto has had too many people stumble into it not understanding what it means to be an investor, and not enough people warned or educated them. But ignorance still isn't an excuse.",1524219311

People will generally trade AAPL -&gt; USD -&gt; GOOG because they don't have direct APPL -&gt; GOOG pairings available (and the fact that you can't own fractions of a stock makes it difficult as well). Same with crypto: you trade DOGE -&gt; BTC -&gt; NEO, because your exchange doesn't offer you a direct DOGE -&gt; NEO pairing.

"SM arises because of two properties of Nakamoto PoW:

1. In a race between two chains, the loser is penalized (wasted hashpower but no block rewards) but the winner is not penalized
2. Difficulty adjustment ensures total long-run rewards are constant

(2) is difficult to remove, but (1) really is a problem. In the fault attribution theory that we use in an ethereum research context, we have a concept of non-uniquely-attributable faults and uniquely attributable faults. A uniquely attributable fault is a case where a protocol fault (ie. any instance of the protocol not running perfectly smoothly, including even single-block forks) is caused by a single actor misbehaving, and it can be unambiguously proven that it's them; the simplest case is an invalid block. In this case, the actor that committed the uniquely attributable fault should be penalized (as they are in bitcoin; they burn hashpower but get no block reward or fees). A non-uniquely-attributable fault is one where it's obvious that either actor A or actor B was at fault, but the protocol can't tell which one it is; the simplest example is a single-block fork. From the data itself, you can't tell if A published first and B failed to build on top of A, or B published first and A failed to build on top of B. In this case, the correct strategy is to penalize both sides of the fork, because you don't actually know who did it. Nakamoto consensus incentivization is suboptimal because it fails to do this. If you do penalize both sides of the fork (that is, if A becomes part of the main chain, then its sister B can later be included as an ""uncle"", and that ensures A's reward gets taken away), and you do this in a generalized way that covers multi-block forks, then you can get perfect 50% selfish mining resistance.

If you just adopt a simple scheme where sisters of main-chain blocks can get included in the chain as uncles and take away the corresponding main-chain blocks' rewards, then with gamma=0 the selfish mining profitability threshold goes up from 33% to 38%, and with gamma=0.5 it goes up from 25% to 33%.",1524216007

u/josiahromoser Cryptocurrency is for everyone and the bais that people have is radical over this chain or that chain. Ive only really just started to learn about the Active Consensoring on /r/bitcoin and its freaky how people choose to instill ideology via this method. The comment you linked to was eye opening as I was unaware of any of this until now. Its fascinating that people in the Crypto space ( we should call it the Blockchain  space because that is the base of all crypto and there for non-discriminatory) hard to  be happy for other projects and usages of Blockchain despite the chain its running on OR to atleast acknowledge other developments within Blockchain space . I personally disliked the initial BCH name stealing fiasco and I see how it could affect future adoption but the bottom line is adoption in general ;to what Chain does not matter. The Memo.cash project is highly interesting and I havent held any interest in BCH before and just stuck with BTC but now ive become interested in the usages of BCH via Memo.cash - I have bais towards BTC but I want to be apart of the new technologies so I wont spite myself like the guys who got you banned at /r/bitcoin - its ignorant.

It is not even about decentralization, which it fails totally with a single private company making all the calls, which makes it totally valueless. It's about it is taken over by a hostile corporate \(AXA\) and backdoorer \(LN\). Few altcoins are more scammy than BCore. BCore does not resolve any problem in Bitcoin.

"Hello FatherSlippyfist,

If you have already read Mastering Bitcoin by Andreas Antonopoulos, we suggest you take a look at books written on Ethereum. It is the biggest platform for dAPPs and Smart Contracts and will give you another view of how the blockchain can be used.

Unfortunately there are not many great books written on the subject as it is such a new technology. Many of the books written on the topic are writing on the potential of the blockchain rather than the technical aspects of it. There is one book we suggest you read, namely Mastering Ethereum also written by Andreas Antonopoulos which will come out around August this year. This means you will have to wait a bit, but based on the quality of his previous books it will be well worth the wait.

With kind regards,

one could consider BTC or other cryptocurremcies as assets with an intrinsic value of being super mobile, secure, private etc etc. that is the true value of crypto IMO. however, they will not be used as a currency on a large scale as long as its deflationary.

"I make your friend right - it looks like we reached a solid bottom, with the tide pushing in the right direction. 

I’ve also been telling my cryptocurious* friends to get in now (having warned them away from crypto during the parabolic phase at end 2017). 

My current portfolio is largely made up of the following:

BTC - this is where much of the new money will go, so I still hold some to catch the upswing. It has seen its use case shift towards being a store of wealth - much like digital gold. But honestly, even with Lightning Network coming in soon, I’m not convinced on its utility beyond that.

ETH - i believe the market cap of ETH will surpass  that of BTC. Huge potential from all the ETH native tokens being developed, some of which will have real utility. A nice analogy was that cryptocurrencies are like investing in Pets.com or Amazon.com during the dotcom bubble, but investing in ETH is akin to investing in the internet protocol itself.

NANO - great project with a real focus on product development rather than marketing. Many say it is the payment coin that Bitcoin should have been - fast and free. Quite risky due to recent exchange/ legal issues, but that is reflected in its price, which is super low right now.

POWR - I have a lot of love for this project. The team is packed with a wide range of experience and the project has the potential to switch millions of people to decentralized renewable energy sources. This is one which really gives me the feels (and has made a decent profit, even during the bear market)

REQ - a project designed to streamline the invoicing and payment request process. I’ve worked at quite a few large companies and am amazed by the amount of people still manually handing accounts receivable and accounts payable. It feels like a nice specific area (if a bit boring!) which is ripe for disruption. 


* I also have a few crypto detractor friends, who ironically mostly work in finance, but have shown disappointing economic nous. 

I always actively seek out opinions opposite to mine. However, their main argument is to parrot the Tulip bubble = BTC line from the FT. Every time they trot out the same argument it makes me more convinced I’m doing the right thing by investing in the crypto space.

My plan is to send them all a dozen tulips on the day I cash out.

"Lol. The lighting network is still expensive and slow compared to Nano, but ok. And BTC and LN are two different things, LN isn't even onchain, it is more like a BTC-standard value transfer with full reserves, which would be a good solution if we didn't already have something better..",1524212738

Not at all and I will explain why. The total number of Bitcoins that can be mined is 21 million. Think about if the Earth had 21 million pounds of gold. Some of that gold is melted down and alloyed with other materials. Some of it is lost at sea never to be recovered. Gold however still has value even though as the years go on there is less of it every year. Bitcoin works exactly the same way. For each coin that is lost and each person that forgot where they put their key when they went to Cold Storage it makes the value of the remaining coins that much higher. It's getting to be pretty difficult to own an entire Bitcoin and in two years it's going to be ridiculously hard or expensive. The next halving is going to happen and that means each block of Bitcoin is only going to be 6.25 coins. The value of Bitcoin either has to go substantially higher or the entire project has to crash. The reason I say it has to go higher is because of the cost of mining. It's getting more and more expensive to extract Bitcoin out of the air,1524211585

"&gt; Bitcoin's stability and conservative approach is the reason that altcoins don't have this burden in our fledgling market and are free to experiment. You should be happy about it

There may be an element of truth to this but to be fair it is wild, wild speculation. Who knows what might or might not have happened if x or y had taken place. Sure Bitcoin appears to have provided a solid foundation for the past couple of years but it has been embattled, faltered, given rise to strange economics, and so on, and as time goes on, many other blockchains will prove highly resilient, maybe even more so that Bitcoin - particularly given attempts to make LN work.

The crypto economy will continue to grow regardless of the success of individual coins, and it may ultimately turn out to be best if BTC went the way of the dinosaur (whether that happens or not).",1524209964

"Let me try.

I think the issue with many platforms is that they think only about a limited usecase in a very specific ruleset in mind (e.g. ERC20 on the ETH Network). 

With ARK you can break that ruleset (highly customized blockchain) as you like but still be part of the ecosytem (on part being the ArkBrige). Before ETH everyone used to fork Bitcoin (as in copy the code), but there was no way for them to interoperate on a standardized level.

With ARK you will have the ability to deploy a plenthora of sidechains (""push-button-sidechains"" or how they call it) that can be totally different in technology but can still exchange information with all other sidechains, also including the mainchain of ARK - optionally as needed. 

Not only that, it's target is also to exchange information with other propitary blockchains like Bitcoin, Ethereum and Monero (say pay with ARK for an smart contract execution on the ETH-Blockchain trough ACES).

It's a really flexible model, that could be used for a combination of private and public blockchains. e.g. your sidechain could be totally hold privat information the general public has no access to e.g. tax information that could exchange information with a permissioned public (=goverment) blockchain as needed, that also hold further public available information.

It's a similiar of what ICON is trying to be, just near completition and totally Open-Source (once released). They aren't aiming the direction ICON is going with direct company support for now. Hence no ""cool partnerships"" to announce ... one could think about a bit like the Linux of Blockchains.

Describing ARK is for sure hard. Correct me where I'm wrong.",1524209562
"Bitcoin was created with the guide of the whitepaper (every coin follows the bitcoin whitepaper to some degree as it was the first) it does so pretty well aside from a few new additions to tackle the scaling issue which the whitepaper did not address that well - I am not in full agreement or disagreement with the additions. i would say Bitcoin and BitcoinCash both follow the whitepaper at the same rate, but even if BitcoinCash were to stick to the whitepaper 100%, it would not become Bitcoin - that's not how things work.",1524209503

"In October 2008, Nakamoto published a paper on the cryptography mailing list at metzdowd.com describing the bitcoin digital currency. It was titled ""Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System"". In January 2009, Nakamoto released the first Bitcoin software that launched the network and the first units of the bitcoin cryptocurrency, called bitcoins. Satoshi Nakamoto released the Version 0.1 of bitcoin software on Sourceforge on 9 January 2009.

Nakamoto claimed that work on the writing of the code began in 2007. The inventor of Bitcoin knew that due to its nature, the core design would have to be able to support a broad range of transaction types. The implemented solution enabled specialized codes and data fields from the start through the use of a predictive script.

Nakamoto created a website with the domain name bitcoin.org and continued to collaborate with other developers on the bitcoin software until mid-2010. Around this time, he handed over control of the source code repository and network alert key to Gavin Andresen, transferred several related domains to various prominent members of the bitcoin community, and stopped his involvement in the project. Until shortly before his absence and handover, Nakamoto made all modifications to the source code himself.

The inventor left a text message in the first mined block which reads 'The Times 3 January 2009 Chancellor on brink of the second bailout for banks'. The text refers to a headline in The Times published on 3 January 2009. It is a strong indication that the first block was mined no earlier than this date.[14] The genesis block has a timestamp of 18:15:05 GMT on 3 January 2009. This block is unlike all other blocks in that it doesn't have a previous block to reference.[14] This required the use of custom code to mine it. Timestamps for subsequent blocks indicate that Nakamoto did not try to mine all the early blocks solely for himself.

As the sole, predominant early miner, the inventor was awarded bitcoin at Genesis and for 10 days afterward. Except for test transactions, these remain unspent since mid-January 2009.The public bitcoin transaction log shows that Nakamoto's known addresses contain roughly one million bitcoins. As of 17 December 2017, this is worth over 19 billion USD.This makes him the 44th richest person on Earth.",1524209316

I genuinely believe a lot of money has gone into the censorship crusade against Bitcoin and unfortunately, unless someone (as yourself) actually digs deeper and looks elsewhere (other than mainstream channels), then you'd be lost.

You raise important questions.... There are many posts and articles similar to u/singularity87  ... trouble is - finding them. And again, this goes back to the whole control of the main channels.

Bitcoin was under attack. If you ask me, I believe that today Bitcoin Cash is also under attack by the same people for the same reasons.

When you hear certain factions say ""bcash"" but NOT ""bgold"" (they say Bitcoin Gold), then you know something is up... It's a war on decentralized currency. - Bitcoin Cash is the only money capable of scaling to global adoption - you better believe it, some don't want that to happen..

E-gold was a digital gold currency operated by Gold &amp; Silver Reserve Inc.

2. Bitcoin does not really have stocks. You can trade bitcoin as if it is a stock though. Price of bitcoin (and other crypto's) fluctuate a lot more than 'regular' stocks on the stockmarket though. Bitcoin can also be shorted wich means you basically gamble that the price is going down. (Do some more research yourself)
3. Most important events are: satoshi nakamoto releasing white paper of bitcoin somewhere in late 2009 i believe. Bitcoin getting adopted on the darkweb, bitcoin cash fork, bitcoin lightning network starting. (Just do some searching and you will probably find a lot more events)
4. Anyone can see transaction made wirh bitcoin on the blockchain. You will kust need the public bitcoin adress of someone. Public adresses however do not show the name of the person it belongs to so it is anonymous in some way. Just fill in public adress at https://www.blockchain.com 
5. How long it takes to make a transaction and whats the fee? I would say try it out for yourself ;)
6. Not my point of expertise but I know there is a new block of bitcoin created every 10 minutes and once a block is mined, all the miners that helped mine this block get a reward. The reward that is given for mining a block goes down every few years and mining difficulty goes up overtime as mining rigs get more advanced and more people start doing it.

"In theory, Bitcoin is partition-tolerant, because ""the proof of work speaks for itself"" and the weaker forks would ultimately be reorganized and orphaned by the strongest one in the event of the network reconnecting or becoming whole again.

In practice, it's likely that other issues would rear their heads. The weaker forks would probably implement protection against such reorganization, for one (which would mean that the split(s) would be permanent), and if enough of the hashpower was divided up, even reaching the next difficulty adjustment block could be problematic and painful, which could conceivably prompt ""emergency"" updates (e.g. a proof-of-work swapout).

Network partitions are *no joke* when it comes to distributed consensus. Bitcoin's ""answer"" boils down to work-proofs, but you're correct to point out that it would be a crazy period with a lot of big unknowns.",1524208390
this is because the whales saw that everyday people were shorting bitcoin so they decided to make them lose money. It will stay around 8300 for a few more days and then they will start shorting btc again and it will drop to around 6.5k..IMO,1524208381

Your friend is smart, Bitcoin is a great coin to hold.If you want to diversify your portfolio I will recommend you not to diverse it too much. 
I personally find it kinda difficult to follow many coins at the same time.

How I diverse it:
Bitcoin - 70% 
Ethereum - 20%
Neo - 5%
PolySwarm - 5%

I’m using some of my profits to get into interesting ICO’s. I don’t recommend you to get into ICO’s when you’re a beginner. If you decide to do so, make sure the company has:1. High-quality team (look at their Linkedin profiles, check that they are legit)2. Active social media channels ( I usually go 1 by 1 to make sure they put some efforts on all the channels)3. Tech - Check their CTO and GitHub page. If you’re not a developer like me, just ask one of your friends(seems like you have many, not like me :P)4. Do you think someone gonna uses this coin? 


Few ICO’s that are on my radar:

1. WeMark - they gonna decentralize Shutterstock. They have an insane tech team and I personally really like the concept.
2. Liberdy - They want companies to pay us when using our data, which is somehow brilliant. With all the hype that’s around facebook scandal now, I think it might be a high potential project.

Few important things:
1. Don’t invest money you can’t afford to lose.
2. Listen to your friend for now, but after few weeks/months develop your own trading style, trust your instincts.
3. Use tools that will give you an advantage over the other people/traders. Tools like cryptopanic, for example, will give you this value.
4. Have fun, don’t think you gonna become a millionaire overnight, learn new things every day, this market is insane, you gonna love it.

"Fair point.

I remember the time in 2015 or beginning of 2016 when big media stopped writing that ""Bitcoin is tulips"", ""Bitcoin is dead"" and started writing SERIOUSLY about how Bitcoin could be ""the next big thing"".

This was a red lamp. And now the red lamp is CNBC writing about how Bitcoin Cash could dethrone Bitcoin-Legacy.",1524208095

Same fees but no credit card rewards. If you're paying with a debit card instead of a credit card or bank transfer you're doing crypto wrong.,1524207782

"Bitcoin is in its infancy right now. I mean it's been out for like 10 years practically but there is still quite a ways to go. It's also more likely to be a store of value and some of the altcoins will be what we use for transactions. No one really knows how many Bitcoins are going to be out there but it's probably going to be 15 to 17 million just guessing on that. A lot of them have already been lost. They are testing the lightning Network right now and if they can get that to work on a large large scale it's really only a matter of time before you have Bitcoin debit cards and they directly take on Visa and MasterCard. When that happens it's probably going to cause a parabolic run and $20,000 will look cheap",1524207713
