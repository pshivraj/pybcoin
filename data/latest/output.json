Only difference is that bloXroute is x1000 more efficient, **and** is provably neutral, which the others are not.

This is indeed the doomsday worst case scenario that bloXroute had to solve, by making it *replaceable*. If bloXroute fails, blockchains and crypto must be able to continue their operation \\(hot swap\\) for 6 months or a year, before deciding what to replace bloXroute with permanently \\(if bloXroute was indeed shut down permanently and not coming back\\).

Even then, if a block is x10 larger, the time it takes for one node to send it to another node increases by x10, the total time is x10 \\(at best\\), and the window of opportunity for forks to occur increases by x10. If you increase by x100, you will see a fork every block \\(when blocks are full\\).\n\nIf you want to know what really changed Bitcoin fundamentals, it was the relay networks which give you the illusion that everything is fine and there is no networking bottleneck, while in reality everyone has to place their trust in the relay networks, who can abuse/censor the network as they please, particularly for on\\-chain scaling.", "created_date": 1527103670}, {"comment": "Its a \"figuratively\" way to create the same effect of a literal bitcoin.

And as for signing his life rights away, timing is important here, i.e. when he thought he would have to reveal. Should I assume you're backing down from the 'outing himself' claim?\n\nI'm not claiming I have solid evidence that the 'leaks' were Craig's doing (though, again, since they contained the fake stuff he made, it's *likely* that he had something to do with it). However, he undoubtedly was the originator of the claims of being Satoshi, no matter how you try to spin it.\n\n&gt; Why is the burden on me? You gave an estimate, I gave a lower one. Either way it doesn't really matter. Let's say there were 1,000 people with this much knowledge, do you see how this reduces the probability that this fraud could/ would be executed?\n\nHow do you know it's not 10,000 or 100,000? In fact, it could be even more. The question is *how many people* **could amass** *the 'knowledge' Craig has about bitcoin if they wanted to pretend to be Satoshi?* It's not how many people *had* the knowledge... \n\n&gt; Too late here for me to read another one of those threads.\n\nSummary: Craig doesn't understand how bitcoin mining is a memoryless process. A technology he supposedly invented.\n\n&gt; Go on, enlighten me.\n\nIt's a variant on the balance fallacy. Just because there are two options doesn't mean their probabilities are equal. \n\n&gt; It seems likely that most of the posting was done or filtered through DK\n\nSo they were time-delayed?\n\n&gt; Type in \"Coin\" and select the suggested \"Coin\" from the autocomplete options. Repeat for Bit. Type in bitcoin.\n\nThis is 2018, and why would Bit and Coin be capitalized then?\n\n&gt; You seem to have avoided my point about why he would take such an extraordinary risk of using O'Hagan.\n\nYou are again overestimating his ability to sniff out a fraud. This is not an empirical claim. We'll have to disagree, since there's nothing to back it up either way. \n\n&gt;  I'm going to guess you don't really know how auditing/ accounting / tax reviews work. Suffice it to say, people don't just rely on people's word. They need to see evidence. And that needs to be documented. That's how it works. You have one out here. That none of the accountants or ATO understood it enough to validate his balances. \n\nAgain, if he had the 1.1m bitcoin, **it would have helped his case**. Why did they continue the case if he had the bitcoin?  Your argument doesn't make sense. \n\n&gt; The odd thing about it is the part about the wallet.dat - if his intention was to plant a seed about being the creator of bitcoin why would he include something that indicates he's trying to scam coins back?\n\nI didn't get a 'scam back' vibe from the email. It looks like: \"Your son did something great! Look for a file you'll never find! Get on board the Dave and Craig are Satoshi train and you'll be rewarded!\"\n\n&gt; I'd say for something to be implausible there would have to be conclusive proof that CSW isn't Satoshi\n\nGive *an example* of what you'd consider *conclusive*, please. I will proceed to shoot it down in a similar vein as what you're doing. \n\n&gt; So what odds are you offering? 100-1 based on your confidence? I presume not.\n\nWell, since you seem to be on the opposite end of the spectrum, 100-1 wouldn't exactly be fair, especially given the risks involved with btc transfers. I'll DM you, though.\n\n&gt; Yes, it was (locally) reported at the time of his house being raided. From memory there was a quote from someone from the electricity supplier and a neighbour validating the point.\n\nI'll take your word for it, but it's incredibly poor evidence either way. There are many uses for upgraded electrical service. Again, he previously claimed to run a supercomputer.\n\n&gt; I'm not a coder. From what I picked up, Craig wasn't doing the coding, someone else / others were.\n\nLOL, he didn't make the posts, he didn't write the code, yet he was the *main part* of Satoshi, utterly *sans evidence*? Interesting...\n\n&gt; Poker just a coincidence then?\n\nAs online betting would be a very obvious, natural use of a nascent online currency, I fail to see how this is even suggestive, let alone a significant coincidence. And I thought you just said Craig didn't code it... :)\n\n&gt;  It isn't, and the subtly is lost on you.\n\nEnlighten me, then. \n\n&gt; So, I have to ask, who do you think Satoshi is?

All the miners are mining on the new rules. Nobody lost money. It was not a contentious upgrade by any means. \n\n&gt; I don't want this to happen to Bitcoin, so fully support soft forks as upgrade mechanism. As much as possible.\n\nSoft forks also create a new chain, as I explained earlier, so there's also the probability of \"the zombie chain\". The benefit of the SegWit soft fork was that **non-mining** nodes aren't forced to upgrade. But non-mining nodes don't mean much in Proof of **Work** anyway. \n\n&gt; Topics like changes to the consensus rules are, by definition, not about Bitcoin, and hence banned. \n\nI think you should really think about this one some more. Changes to the consensus rules have always been discussed on the forums. Where else, it's supposed to be a decentralized development. Blockstream has been discussing *a small increase* too. Just people that disagree with them have been censored. \n\nThere was a problem, scaling, and so a discussion was needed. Well, one side of the discussion was censored away, so naturally, only the other remained - off-chain solutions. How is relying on off-chain solutions more Bitcoin than letting it scale through bigger blocks, as intended [since it's creation](ssh://please-ask-me-about-this-one_its-obvious_Ill-explain)? \n\n&gt;  If you now add a few special rules (no discussion of \"censorship\" and no promotion of BCH... I think you'll agree that's for obvious reasons) you have the r-bitcoin moderation policy.\n\n\"No discussion of anything Blockstream dislikes\" is my definition of the r/bitcoin's policy. They have no problem having most their top post about BCH and LTC when it fits their narrative (BCH hate and LTC love). \n\n&gt; \"everything else\": I think you're probably referring to the push back seen lately against BCH. Someone put this very nicely - This is Bitcoin's 'immune system' getting activated. It's a natural reaction to all the confusion about Bitcoin that has been promoted lately. Even Mike Novogratz thought it necessary to chime in.\n\n&gt; I don't think that's censorship, that's people protecting what they hold dear. Possibly playing dirty. But as they say, all's fair in love and war...\n\nI take this as the fruit of the censorship. Manipulating the community for 3 years will inevitably brainwash them. You can clearly see it when they are not even making sense. Blockstream changed it's narrative so often that their explanation of their actions are not logical anymore, but people that have spent long time on the censored forums just blindly follow anything they're told there. \n", "created_date": 1527098623}, {"comment": "Which is happening all the time.

Did he willingly sign away his 'life rights' or not? That's the important question.\n\nIf your reference point is O'Hagan, then from memory this isn't right.  His ex colleague built the nChain deal.  As for willing - he needed the money, he had a financial crisis, so I would say it wasn't a free choice, more a forced one.  And as for signing his life rights away, timing is important here, i.e. when he thought he would have to reveal.  Should I assume you're backing down from the 'outing himself' claim?\n\n&gt;The burden is on you, and you haven't given anything to support it.\n\nWhy is the burden on me?  You gave an estimate, I gave a lower one.  Either way it doesn't really matter.  Let's say there were 1,000 people with this much knowledge, do you see how this reduces the probability that this fraud could/ would be executed?\n\n&gt;Nope, wrong bet\n\nToo late here for me to read another one of those threads.\n\n&gt;I hope you know why this is a bad argument.\n\nGo on, enlighten me.\n\n&gt;No, his post time distribution suggests a single person living in the US\n\nIt seems likely that most of the posting was done or filtered through DK\n\n&gt;You made the claim that it was potentially autocorrect, so the burden is on you to substantiate that\n\nType in \"Coin\" and select the suggested \"Coin\" from the autocomplete options.  Repeat for Bit.  Type in bitcoin.\n\n&gt;I'm not sure if I've ever seen a text from Craig that had no mistakes, let alone many thousands of words. This would be remarkable.\n\nIf I could be bothered, I'd find some stuff to refute this.  But I can't.\n\n&gt;The Tulip Trust is fake. The PGP keys were backdated. Do you dispute that?\n\nI do not dispute the keys were backdated.  It remains to be seen if the trust is fake or not.  We have a timeline on that at least.\n\n&gt;Again, I admitted that it's possible but highly unlikely, and gave reasons for that. It is hardly the best piece of evidence, but it is completely consistent with him being a fraud, and inconsistent with him being Satoshi.\n\nI will grant you that it does look a bit odd.  But then Craig is a bit odd.  \n\n&gt;Some agreement, though Craig (and other conmen) know that they don't have to fool everyone. Indeed, I'd say most of the crypto community didn't take his bait, but enough did for him to carve out a niche for himself. Even O'Hagan himself is still fairly ambivalent.\n\nI think O'Hagan isn't ambivalent about Craig being Satoshi.  Read between the lines, watch other interviews he's given after.  He believes it's Craig but doesn't want to be so blunt about it.  His article explains this better than I did towards the end.\n\nYou seem to have avoided my point about why he would take such an extraordinary risk of using O'Hagan.  Think about it this way, if O'Hagan had sussed his scam after say a few months of work on it, he's going to write an article roasting the fraudster.  End of game for CSW.  So why would he take this risk?  The selection of O'Hagan was not chance.  \n\n&gt;Ok, I'll clarify. There's no publicly available evidence. However, why would they need to establish that he actually possessed the 1.1m btc? They don't need that to make their case against him. In fact, it would weaken their case.\n\nI'm struggling how to put this without coming across as condescending.  I'm going to guess you don't really know how auditing/ accounting / tax reviews work.  Suffice it to say, people don't just rely on people's word.  They need to see evidence.  And that needs to be documented.  That's how it works.  You have one out here.  That none of the accountants or ATO understood it enough to validate his balances.  But that still remains difficult to rationalise because CSW would be exposing himself (at a time of huge financial stress) to further financial pressure.\n\n&gt;Unless he's a tax cheat, so what?\n\nI never said I didn't think he's a tax avoider.  But the point is more he was in financial strife and this would take him in the wrong direction \n\n&gt;I don't see why you think this is so unbelievable. If I were going to involve my dead friend, I'd try to plant some seeds with his family first. Nothing odd about it.\n\nThe odd thing about it is the part about the wallet.dat  - if his intention was to plant a seed about being the creator of bitcoin why would he include something that indicates he's trying to scam coins back?\n\n&gt;There are infinite 'possibilities', but only one that is plausible.\n\nI'd say for something to be implausible there would have to be conclusive proof that CSW isn't Satoshi, which you haven't presented.\n\n&gt;Well over 99%. I'm willing to back that up with a bet, if you're interested.\n\nSo what odds are you offering?  100-1 based on your confidence?  I presume not.  But I am interested in a bet.  Timescales would be the tricky part. 2020 is the obvious deadline with the Tulip trust, but that is a bit of a long term bet.  Not to come across as trying to be baller here, but I would be wanting to do something in size for it to be worth my while.  Let me know if interested and what odds, but let's do that DM pls.\n\n&gt;He claims to have run a supercomputer as well. Do you have evidence for this 'industrial level electricity'?\n\nYes, it was (locally) reported at the time of his house being raided.  From memory there was a quote from someone from the electricity supplier and a neighbour validating the point.\n\n&gt;This is much less compelling than the fact that there's zero evidence that Craig could code C++ at all during that period (despite highly detailed resumes available), much less at a level indicative of a professional. Even Craig's pseudocode is buggy. See figures 2 and 10.\n\nI'm not a coder.  From what I picked up, Craig wasn't doing the coding, someone else / others were.\n\nPoker just a coincidence then?\n\n&gt;This is like saying an American would have chosen an American pseudonym...\n\nIt isn't, and the subtly is lost on you.\n\n&gt;Utterly shocked, honestly.

But on HFs, this might be true when there's a few geeks involved, not with global infrastructure being built on top. Look at the latest BCH HF, ~20% of the network was left behind. And that's with a lot less infrastructure behind it than BTC. HFs are not \"bad\" on their own, they just increase the probability that something goes wrong.

As much as possible.\n\n&gt;I didn't mean in numbers but in hash power. You'll say \"No way\", but what I mean is, miners mine what's profitable.

Topics like changes to the consensus rules are, by definition, not about Bitcoin, and hence banned. That's not censorship, just enticing moderation policy. If you now add a few special rules (no discussion of \"censorship\" and no promotion of BCH...

BTC has basically zero adoption right now and price exploded to $10k+. 99% of people own zero BTC and the 1% who do own it have extremely limited use for it. Mainly it's for hodling or trading, trying to play the volatility markets.\n\nWhen BTC captures an industry, it doesn't really matter what it is, when it dominates any industry as THE way to trade, value will skyrocket. That skyrocket will self-perpetuate another cycle of boom and bust, but the settling point will be far higher than today's prices.

On why biggers blocks don't bring centralization: Not only that tech like storage and bandwidth improves exponentially, thus running full nodes is cheaper, we BCH supporters also claim that it's not rational for everyone to run a full node. Unless you are a merchant or a hobbyist, SPV is all you need to be secure. \n3. The biggest problem with BTC is not it's scaling, it's the censorship and manipulation over the community. From 2008 till about 2015, everyone knew how Bitcoin will scale. It was in the whitepaper, Satoshi made it clear in many of his emails, the community was united.

That's the important question.\n\n&gt; The evidence is in the post. I suggested my estimate. What would you like, a receipt? Or perhaps you can show me your evidence the number is higher?\n\nThe burden is on you, and you haven't given anything to support it. \n\n&gt; A whole lot of fuss because he said a negative gamma when meaning something else.\n\nNope, wrong bet. [See here](http://archive.is/6C3C9).\n\n&gt; And there is no evidence that there wasn't a team, so perhaps at best you could argue either was equally likely. \n\nI hope you know why this is a bad argument. \n\n&gt; Except if you consider what was involved from Satoshi's side I would estimate it more likely it were a team.\n\nNo, his post time distribution suggests a single person, and the code could absolutely be done by one person (I speak as a professional). \n\n&gt; How do you know that?\n\nYou made the claim that it was potentially autocorrect, so the burden is on you to substantiate that. It's highly unlikely, since 'Bit Coin' was never an accepted way of spelling Bitcoin, and I doubt it would have been in any autocomplete dictionary back then.\n\n&gt; For me it's too insignificant to imply anything. Perhaps Craig was extra cautious about what he typed as Satoshi, fearing he may reveal himself with his language/errors?\n\nI'm not sure if I've *ever* seen a text from Craig that had no mistakes, let alone many thousands of words. This would be *remarkable*. Also consider that Craig lived in Australia during the Satoshi period, and Satoshi's post timestamp distribution is utterly inconsistent with someone living there. Yes, he could have written mostly in the dead middle of the night and almost never in the early afternoon, but that's *highly implausible* and yet another hurdle that you have to tell a story to get around. \n\n&gt; Maybe he didn't want to access the satoshi wallets? Maybe he couldn't (Tulip trust)? \n\nThe Tulip Trust is fake. The PGP keys were backdated. Do you dispute that?\n\n&gt; Maybe he was mucking about with trading? Maybe there was another reason that didn't pop into my head?\n\nAgain, I admitted that it's *possible but highly unlikely*, and gave reasons for that. It is hardly the best piece of evidence, but it is completely consistent with him being a fraud, and inconsistent with him being Satoshi. \n\n&gt; he had conman balls of steel\n\nSome agreement, though Craig (and other conmen) know that they don't have to fool *everyone*. Indeed, I'd say *most* of the crypto community didn't take his bait, but enough did for him to carve out a niche for himself. Even O'Hagan himself is still fairly ambivalent. \n\n&gt; OK this is going to sound a bit silly, but where's your evidence that there's no evidence with the ATO, KPMG, EY? As far as I am aware this is not public information. What I do know is that if you have an accountant representing you (especially from two big 4 firms as he had) then they would be managing their own risk by doing due diligence. EY were his internal audit.\n\nOk, I'll clarify. There's no publicly available evidence. However, why would they *need to establish that he actually possessed the 1.1m btc*? They don't need that to make their case against him. In fact, it would weaken their case. \n\n&gt; In the world of tax liabilities, that's a tax liability.\n\nUnless he's a tax cheat, so what?\n\n&gt; So you are saying that it's plausible that he premeditated this several years before with his best friend's 94 year old dad who had lost his son but then never used this himself, just hoped it would come out.\n\nI believe they interviewed members of the Kleiman family back in 2015 or so, or at least Craig plausibly believed they would, since the 'leak' pointed to Dave. So this is totally consistent with what Craig 'should have done' to enact the fraud. I don't see why you think this is so unbelievable. If I were going to involve my dead friend, I'd try to plant some seeds with his family first. Nothing odd about it.\n\n&gt; Yes, clearly first level thinking leads you to conclude HE'S A SCAMMER!! Second level thinking is he could be a scammer or he could have a reason to leave some doubt/ wriggle room if he ends up in court related to Silk Road. Both are possibilities.\n\nThere are infinite 'possibilities', but only one that is plausible.\n\n&gt; I ask you this - what level of confidence do you have that CSW was not part of Satoshi? As a %\n\nWell over 99%. I'm willing to back that up with a bet, if you're interested. \n\n&gt; I also ask you why, if he was not mining heavily in the early days, did his house (in a residential suburb) have industrial level electricity being pumped into it?\n\nHe claims to have run a supercomputer as well. Do you have evidence for this 'industrial level electricity'?\n\n&gt; How about the 'coincidence' that early versions of the bitcoin client had poker op codes in it? (Given CSW's history of working with poker sites and on the money transfer problems they were having)\n\nThis is much less compelling than the fact that there's zero evidence that Craig could code C++ *at all* during that period (despite highly detailed resumes available), much less at a level indicative of a professional. Even Craig's [pseudocode is buggy](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3160279). See figures 2 and 10.\n\n&gt; There are so many other things. All circumstantial. Like the choice of the The Times headline for the first block - an american would have chosen an american paper. The Times is exactly the sort of choice CSW would have made.\n\nThis is like saying an American would have chosen an American pseudonym...\n\n&gt; If conclusive evidence did emerge to validate CSW how would you feel?\n\nUtterly shocked, honestly. Like if aliens invaded tomorrow. \n\n&gt; I'm enjoying this discussion, I wanted to thrash this out for some time. I really want to learn how people like you can be so convinced that it's not him.\n\nYou might enjoy [this conversation](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/80jzhm/kleiman_v_craig_wright_the_bitcoins_that_never/duzqkag/), then. \n\n&gt; You seem too smart to fall at the first hurdle that he appears to be a scammer\n\nWhat would convince *you* that he's a fraud?

Just like 1 bitcoin today is worth one bitcoin 5 years ago and worth one bitcoin 5 years from now. The point is, if I can break this down to ELI5 for you, the stuff you can buy with 200k today is less than the stuff you could have bought with 200k last year. Fact.

Your own speculation or just blind hope?\n\nBased on a solid understanding of how revolutionary the technology is. It is a deflationary asset. It offers a tremendous advantage to disenfranchised people all over the world. So broad adoption will happen eventually. As long as it remains highly volatile it's use as a currency is limited. Even if it remained primarily a store-of-value it'd be as good as gold. But it's actually better than gold. You can't spend gold the way you spend cash. You can't email gold to someone. You can't store or transport gold safely and securely without great effort and expense. \n\nPlease show me your research that people are overwhelmingly less willing to take responsibility for the security of their own wealth.

If you want to prove you are Satoshi, it's simple. Just sign with your private key. \n\nWe are using maths to protect our property. What we need is faith in this idea, or your money will be under the control of others. Why do we choose bitcoin? Why not other cryptocurrencies, or rather, just partly in other cryptocurrencies? Because we believe in the maths. Don't put your faith in human nature and sensibilities, just believe in one thing - as long as we have the key, we are satoshi. If you lost the key, even if you were satoshi, you wouldn't be able to prove it. Some &lt;inaudible&gt; you have to challenge, with logic and rationality. Craig is a fake Satoshi, and extremely rude too. While he was speaking, I respected him. I just wanted to propose a mature, accepted standard for our industry, to establish whether someone really is Satoshi. However he was so rude, and even wanted us to pick a side. Do you guys really want to pick a side? What if Taiwan only had a single political party? This is an insult to our democratic society. How did we get to the point where we are meeting up today? It's because we respected everyone's freedom of speech. Craig is a disgrace upon this community. I just wanted to have a peaceful discussion, and yet he, over and over again - he did the same yesterday at the closed-door meeting - he wanted us to pick a side, \"Either he goes or I go\" and he continued to do so today. He's a disgrace of Australia, a disgrace of our entire community.

Unique in the Netherlands, claims the company that buys and sells bitcoins on behalf of its customers.\nYou just have to take a look at the course of the bitcoin to see how erratic the price trend is. On the 6th of May, 1 bitcoin scored just under 10,000 dollars, now the digital currency is under 8000 dollars.\nWith a bit of bad luck, the crypto investor lost part of his deposit next day. BTC Direct employees know the whip and are not awake. Not even if some of their own hard-earned money will evaporate.\nThe employees received an e-mail a few months ago asking whether they wanted to receive part of their salary in bitcoins and if so, for what amount. The result: everyone wanted to participate and on average for an amount of 100 euros per month. The minimum amount is 20 euros and the highest 500 euros.\nThere was no question of peer pressure, spokesman Jerrymie Marcus of the trading platform emphasizes. \"To be honest, only enthusiasts who also act from idealism work here.\"\nIt is not surprising that the plan does not come from the management, but from employees. One of those people is 33-year-old Roy Spies. He has studied leisure management and has been working at BTC Direct for a year at the customer contact department.\n,, I buy a few hundred euros of cryptocurrency every month. I find it convenient that this will automatically be done later. And it saves me transaction costs of 2 percent, \"says the employee from Tiel. He has opted for a monthly amount of 300 euros. According to the current price, that would be 0.043 bitcoin. ,, I admit: that may sound very little, but all in all it is a nice amount. ''\nDespite his enthusiasm, he does see a few downsides. One is that BTC Direct purchases at a fixed time in the month. That may be just at a time when the price is unfavorable. \"But on the other hand, it can also be just at a favorable moment,\" he adds.\nAnother disadvantage, he thinks, is that BTC Direct only pays out in bitcoin. ,, In addition to bitcoin, I also have other digital coins such as ether and litecoin. I would also have liked to choose another digital currency. ''\nSpies thinks that his boss does this very well. He believes that the bitcoin will be around 100,000 euros by 2020 and will become an accepted payment method worldwide. ,, Then it is nice that I already get paid a part in bitcoin. ''\nIn the Netherlands, BTC Direct seems to be the first company that gives employees bitcoins. Dutch law does have one restriction: an employer must pay at least the minimum wage in euros. Anything that exceeds that amount may be paid in bitcoin. In Germany and Japan there are also companies that pay their employees bitcoin. Meanwhile, more than half a million Dutch people have bitcoin or other cryptocurrency.", "created_date": 1527092393}, {"comment": "**Bitcoin (BTC) Basic Info:** [Website](https://bitcoin.org) - r/Bitcoin - [Abstract](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoWikis/wiki/Bitcoin_basicinfo#wiki_short_description) - [History](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoWikis/wiki/Bitcoin_basicinfo#wiki_history) - [Exchanges](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoWikis/wiki/Bitcoin_basicinfo#wiki_exchanges) - [Wallets](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoWikis/wiki/Bitcoin_basicinfo#wiki_wallets) \n\n**Biases:** [Arguments For](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoWikis/wiki/Bitcoin_pros) &amp; [Arguments Against](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoWikis/wiki/Bitcoin_cons) | **CryptoWikis:** [Policy](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/wiki/policy#wiki_cryptowikis_program_-_.28work_in_progress.29) - [Contribute Content](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoWikis/wiki/contributing)\n\n---\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

The place: planet earth. The characters: People from two different countries (or maybe two half of the planet, like today, the world have 2 different political and economical pov, maybe 3) \nIn one, lets call it Happyland, BCH is the actual currency, and that has empowered people, and they just become smarter, and make progress in tecnology, medicine, science, politics. Has less violence (virtually 0 violence) everyone is free, and love and treat with respect each other. Economics become a way to keep everyone wealthy, and they do help each other out when in need. There is not rich neither poor. They all live with all the luxury (wich has become natural) and enjoy a great society.\nIn the other hand, Sadland (you gotta pick better names haha) is the opposite. They just keep FIAT or choose another cryptocurrency (not gonna choose one, could be anything, even a fake one, like Sadcoin) that is not a cryptocurrency at all, It is just controlled by the goverment, who is the only one who can trade it, sell it and mine it. Of course, people from the goverment are pretty rich, but everyone else is poor and sad. No one knows the actual price of anything, cause it fluctuates so bad due to inflation and gov control and manipulation, that people just does not buy anymore. They just live with the food the gov give them, and do what the gov says. BCH is illegal of course, and so is the internet. There is a bunch of brave man who try to fight the opression from the shadows, and try to give people some happiness, but are in clear disadvantages. And of course, they can't leave the country (i can go on in the characteristics of both countries, especially the 2nd one, but i think you got the idea already)\nI mean, this is not the history. This is the context for several stories to happen. One about the resistance in sadland fighting the man. One about a little kid learning about BCH in happiland. One about some romantic girl in happiland how fall in love with a rebel from sadland how talk to her thru the illegal internet connection they have, and how imposible is their love. One about great technologic innovations in happiland. One about a 17 yo guy who get in prison because of fight for justice. I mean, you can write a lot from here (if you find this interesting) \nRemember i say maybe a 3rd country? Maybe there is an island where they adopted dogecoin (or some funny crypto) and they are all poor but fat and really happy, and live in harmony with the nature, and eat from her, and stuff. Or maybe there is dogs who evolved due to technology in happiland and become pretty smart (i mean, for a dog, they are like a 6 yo and can talk) and they decide to move to that island and make his own country, Dogeland haha.

He willingly 'gave it up'.\n\nBut you said he outed himself, which there is no evidence for, but I guess circumstantial is OK when it supports your argument.  And he was hardly \"willing\" as you described.  Watch the videos again.  \n\n&gt;Evidence?\n\nThe evidence is in the post.  I suggested my estimate.  What would you like, a receipt?  Or perhaps you can show me your evidence the number is higher?\n\n&gt;See his bet with Peter Rizun.\n\nI have.  A whole lot of fuss because he said a negative gamma when meaning something else.  This demonstrates the level of scrutiny he's under and there are relatively few of these controversies. \n\n&gt;Right, but 1) there's no evidence for a team, and 2) there's no evidence that they 'switched roles', and 3) this is special pleading.\n\nAnd there is no evidence that there wasn't a team, so perhaps at best you could argue either was equally likely.  Except if you consider what was involved from Satoshi's side I would estimate it more likely it were a team.  \n\n&gt;Sure, but it wouldn't capitalize **that**.\n\nHow do you **know** that?\n\n&gt;And the real Satoshi made nary a mistake. Doesn't that imply Craig never was 'that role'?\n\nFor me it's too insignificant to imply anything.  Perhaps Craig was extra cautious about what he typed as Satoshi, fearing he may reveal himself with his language/errors?\n\n&gt;Craig supposedly had access to 1 million+ bitcoins. For someone like that to be actively trading fewer than 50 is unlikely, but not impossible.\n\nMaybe he didn't want to access the satoshi wallets?  Maybe he couldn't (Tulip trust)? Maybe he was trading for someone else?  Maybe he was mucking about with trading? Maybe there was another reason that didn't pop into my head?\n\n&gt;HAHAHAHA! Seriously?! Are we talking about the same Craig here? The blatant plagiarizer? Come on...\n\nYou don't understand him.  Watch his latest video, from coingeek.  It's a small example but during that he calls out his team and references their support.  He doesn't make a big deal of it but he does it.  I've seen this from him a few times.  I've worked with plenty of people who take all the credit and Craig is not one of those.\n\n&gt;Correct. Have you read The Lord of the Rings and think it's a true story?\n\nYes and no.  Although it is pretty reflective of real life . . .\n\n&gt;Your evidence that Craig is Satoshi is that a journalist got that impression?\n\nNo, because it's not as simple of having one piece of evidence, like a crypto signature.  My point is that another hurdle CSW would have to overcome would be to trick a sharp mind.  Not only by himself, but relying upon all those around him.  This would be an extreme risk that could simply be avoided by going with a lightweight journalist.  Either he was real or he had conman balls of steel. The fact that he would have to rely on others around him suggests to me if he was a fraud he would not have taken this risk.\n\n&gt;No, there's no evidence that he actually possessed the 1.1m bitcoins. The issue was that he claimed R&amp;D tax credits that he wasn't entitled to. To support that, he claimed ownership of the bitcoin. There was no evidence, though.\n\nOK this is going to sound a bit silly, but where's your evidence that there's no evidence with the ATO, KPMG, EY?  As far as I am aware this is not public information.  What I do know is that if you have an accountant representing you (especially from two big 4 firms as he had) then they would be managing their own risk by doing due diligence.  EY were his internal audit.  KPMG were his tax advisors.  I'm not sure who did his external audit but I presume there was a third accounting firm too.  All three of these parties would have seen evidence of balances.  As would the ATO.  And these papers have been submitted by lawyers in the suit against him so there's further support that this is more than fabrication in CSW's mind.  \n\n&gt;There would not be any liability unless he sold it.\n\nIn the world of tax liabilities, that's a tax liability.\n\n&gt;We know he was planting the seeds of the fraud back in that time period, as evidenced by the fake blog post.\n\nSo you are saying that it's plausible that he premeditated this several years before with his best friend's 94 year old dad who had lost his son but then never used this himself, just hoped it would come out.  Seriously? This is just one example, there are many things like this he'd have to have done to create the backstory, just consider what he would have to do for the O'Hagan interview - astonishing planning and execution.  \n\n&gt;So what do you think about the link that shows the 1.1m bitcoin are not actually Craig's or Dave's?\n\nTo be honest, I'm not sure what to make of this (I've seen it before).  Craig gave wallet addresses that were fake at the same time as giving a fake signing.  The two points are probably linked. Yes, clearly first level thinking leads you to conclude HE'S A SCAMMER!! Second level thinking is he could be a scammer or he could have a reason to leave some doubt/ wriggle room if he ends up in court related to Silk Road.  Both are possibilities.\n\nI ask you this - what level of confidence do you have that CSW was not part of Satoshi?  As a %\n\nI also ask you why, if he was not mining heavily in the early days, did his house (in a residential suburb) have industrial level electricity being pumped into it?\n\nHow about the 'coincidence' that early versions of the bitcoin client had poker op codes in it? (Given CSW's history of working with poker sites and on the money transfer problems they were having)\n\nThere are so many other things.  All circumstantial.  Like the choice of the The Times headline for the first block - an american would have chosen an american paper.  The Times is exactly the sort of choice CSW would have made.  I know what you're thinking - this isn't proof.  i know it isn't, but these points all add up.  \n\nI am not 100% CSW was part of Satoshi but I am close to it.  To be honest, I'd prefer to find out he was a conman.  Why?  Because that would be a fascinating story and there would be a Satoshi out there still to be found.\n\nOne last question.  If conclusive evidence did emerge to validate CSW how would you feel?\n\nI'm enjoying this discussion, I wanted to thrash this out for some time. I really want to learn how people like you can be so convinced that it's not him.  You seem too smart to fall at the first hurdle that he appears to be a scammer / not likeable guy therefore he must be one. \n\n\n\n\n", "created_date": 1527092221}, {"comment": "I don't speak Chinese, but here is my interpretation of this:\n\n[30s before video]: Questioner (guy on the right side of the room) asks a few questions about Craig Wright being Satoshi, and records to prove it.\n\n[15s before video]: The person filming knows this is going to be good and reaches for a camera.\n\n[0:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfOlE-mmYBo): Faketoshi: Excuse me, have you had an affair?

Sure it's a gamble, but bitcoin is a safer bet than any state financial system that obviously doesn't care about fiscally responsible monetary policy. When you understand what value (not monetary value) bitcoin really brings to the table, it's a damn safe bet! I sure wouldn't bet on that 1/2% interest rate your money is earning to overcome the inflation that will absolutely render it much less valuable.\n\nSecurity? Bitcoin is far more secure than banks, but only if you take responsibility for it yourself. Regardless of how much Bitcoin I have, it'll never be worth any arbitrarily large group of hackers effort to try and attack me because I have my private keys secured. They simply can't get it. It isn't available to anyone but me, and if I pass away my family will be able to take possession of it because I have it secured properly. It's not that hard to do. It just takes mindful responsibility. Something you're too afraid of or just lack the confidence to take responsibility for.

Unique in the Netherlands, claims the company that buys and sells bitcoins on behalf of its customers.\n\nYou just have to take a look at the course of the bitcoin to see how erratic the price trend is. On the 6th of May, 1 bitcoin scored just under 10,000 dollars, now the digital currency is under 8000 dollars.\n\nWith a bit of bad luck, the crypto investor lost part of his deposit next day. BTC Direct employees know the whip and are not awake. Not even if some of their own hard-earned money will evaporate.\n\nThe employees received an e-mail a few months ago asking whether they wanted to receive part of their salary in bitcoins and if so, for what amount. The result: everyone wanted to participate and on average for an amount of 100 euros per month. The minimum amount is 20 euros and the highest 500 euros.\n\nThere was no question of peer pressure, spokesman Jerrymie Marcus of the trading platform emphasizes. \"To be honest, only enthusiasts who also act from idealism work here.\"\n\nIt is not surprising that the plan does not come from the management, but from employees. One of those people is 33-year-old Roy Spies. He has studied leisure management and has been working at BTC Direct for a year at the customer contact department.\n\n,, I buy a few hundred euros of cryptocurrency every month. I find it convenient that this will automatically be done later. And it saves me transaction costs of 2 percent, \"says the employee from Tiel. He has opted for a monthly amount of 300 euros. According to the current price, that would be 0.043 bitcoin. ,, I admit: that may sound very little, but all in all it is a nice amount. ''\n\nDespite his enthusiasm, he does see a few downsides. One is that BTC Direct purchases at a fixed time in the month. That may be just at a time when the price is unfavorable. \"But on the other hand, it can also be just at a favorable moment,\" he adds.\n\nAnother disadvantage, he thinks, is that BTC Direct only pays out in bitcoin. ,, In addition to bitcoin, I also have other digital coins such as ether and litecoin. I would also have liked to choose another digital currency. ''\n\nSpies thinks that his boss does this very well. He believes that the bitcoin will be around 100,000 euros by 2020 and will become an accepted payment method worldwide. ,, Then it is nice that I already get paid a part in bitcoin. ''\n\nIn the Netherlands, BTC Direct seems to be the first company that gives employees bitcoins. Dutch law does have one restriction: an employer must pay at least the minimum wage in euros. Anything that exceeds that amount may be paid in bitcoin. In Germany and Japan there are also companies that pay their employees bitcoin.

Somehow I think that the latter makes more sense since there have been so many clues around that area \\(attack, early, code, \"Try \\+1\", infinity, and maybe 00212121 itself\\).\n\nIf 00212121 is the actual clue, I think it is related to the generation of BIP39 seeds. A BIP39 seed is constructed by a series of eight three\\-tuples of words. One digit could represent one three\\-tuple. For example it could be the number of words of each tuple that has a certain property.\n\n**\\-\\- Limited area \\-\\-**\n\nSpeaking of areas in the puzzle, it is noteworthy that **all \"clue words\" has landed within a quite small total area**. First of all, they are obviously all in the white part of the puzzle. But even within the white part we are mostly confined to an area around 8:30 \\- 10 o'clock and 3\\-9 o'clock. **I think even the clue \"almost open\" might refer to the word \"open\" being \"almost\" in the area of interest** which would mean that the famous \"X\" might mark the area boundary, perhaps together with the infinity sign in the northwest.\n\n**\\-\\- \"Missing P:s theory\" \\-\\-**\n\nAs mentioned in a previous comment: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8kk0pa/1\\_btc\\_is\\_hidden\\_in\\_this\\_puzzle\\_good\\_luck/dzfg5eo](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8kk0pa/1_btc_is_hidden_in_this_puzzle_good_luck/dzfg5eo)\n\nGood luck!", "created_date": 1527089545}, {"comment": "What a refreshing post, although I cant quite grasp why you dont see Ver as a scam.

There is evidence of him being Satoshi, however it's circumstantial.  Regardless, I maintain neither of these things conclusively mean he couldn't have been Satoshi. \n\n&gt;He outed himself\n\nAnd your evidence for this is where?  I presume you're assuming he placed the leaks with Gizmodo et al?  Where is your proof of this?  Let's hope you're not hypocritical when it comes to proof.\n\n&gt;So do hundreds of others. Maybe I'm Satoshi.\n\nMaybe you are the disgruntled third man in the team?  However I would suggest the number isn't in hundreds but maybe around 100.  That reduces the number of people on this planet that could execute this 'fraud' by about 99.99999%.  \n\n&gt;He doesn't grasp memoryless mining at a fundamental level.\n\nYou'd have to provide me with a reference for this sweeping statement.\n\n&gt;So are you trying to have it both ways here? He doesn't write anything like Satoshi, but occasionally he does?\n\nDid you even read my response?  A three person team.  Sometimes he posted as Satoshi, sometimes someone else did.  Not that hard to understand I would have thought.\n\n&gt;Autocorrect wouldn't capitalize it,\n\nActually many autocorrects do capitalise things.  We have seen that CSW isn't too bothered about typos.\n\n&gt;It doesn't rule him out absolutely, but it makes it less likely.\n\nWhy?\n\n&gt;Even his business partners call out that bullshit line:... He freaking loves it. Why was I so certain he\u2019d do that BBC interview the next day? It\u2019s adoration. He wants this more than we want this, but he wants to come out of this looking like he got dragged into it\n\nThis was someone's opinion.  Was this person a psychologist?  Did he really know what motivates Craig?  Clearly Craig has a big ego, so maybe there was a part of him that wanted recognition.  But if you read the O'Hagan piece really he comes across at someone who's been rejected by the crypto community and is torn between craving their respect and hating them all.  If you watch how he behaves in all of the interviews his manner, words, and body language all leak how much he doesn't want to do it.  Part of that, in my opinion is probably because he didn't want to take full credit, given it was a team.  On that point, have you read Sconty's account?  I presume if you've read it you think it all fan fiction, besides there's no proof therefore it can't possibly be true.\n\n&gt;That's terrible evidence. Frauds are most effective in person. O'Hagan has no technical expertise, either.\n\nI'm not sure if you're familiar with O'Hagan's work but if you are then you'd understand his assessment of character is well beyond your average journalist.  The fact that he wasn't really interested in the technology adds weight to his character evaluation as he wasn't being bamboozled with new technology, he was looking at the man.  \n\nSo, you don't believe the early mined coins referenced in the law suit have anything to do with CSW or DK?  You linked the court papers there, and there is plenty of evidence in that to suggest otherwise.  A couple of examples - \n\nPoint 62.  Reference to various documents and transcripts with the ATO and accountant to evidence 1.1m bitcoins.  I don't know if you know how these things work but accountants and tax authorities don't just take people's word on things, they AUDIT.  Plus, under your theory, back in 2014 CSW was lying to tax authorities and accountants that he had a potentially huge tax liability all to cover a planned 2 year later play to present himself as Satoshi? A really long play.  It just does not seem plausible.\n\nPoint 104 CSW emails DK's dad in 2014.  Under your theory, after his best friend dies he emails his 94 year old father to make this fictitious claim about inventing bitcoin and give him a red herring about searching for a wallat.dat file which never existed.  All so there was some evidence (which didn't come out until it was being used against him) that he was Satoshi?

Fiat, apart from being implemented sporadically historically, is a relatively new phenomena, for the majority of human civilisation we've associated our money with assets such as gold, importantly being due to the scarcity of such assets. Now we've handed over control of our monetary management and supply to a cabal of elitists and bureaucrats, who are more than capable of making human error which can have highly negative consequences for our society. \n\n\"the debt to gdp ratio doesn't grow exponentially\" \n\nYes well it would have been interesting in '08 hadn't the State bailed out the corporate criminals, and actually let events play out on a natural or even moral basis. Let alone policies such as quantitative easing, artificially injecting the economy with helicopter money. Temporary bandaid solutions for a much larger underlying wound. \n\n\"yes, i agree. Wars are expensive.\"\n\nAnd immoral. Perhaps without fake fiat dollars the West would be more hesitant to constantly poke the hornets nest in the Middle East, stirring up tensions before deciding it's a great idea to let millions of third worlders from often extremely divergent cultures come and settle in western nations, often on the public purse?

They've since gone heavily into debt with the increase in the size of their state and state programs, welfare, stupid proxy wars and economic mismanagement (all empires rise and fall after all). So I don't expect the elite or Statists in America to willingly or altruistically reduce the size of the state apparatus (which costs trillions to run, with all the McGubbment workers and programs) because that would reduce their own power, and result in many angry and desperate citizens (the Free Shit Army is accustomed to receiving milk from the government teat now, and if it ever runs dry, it won't be pretty). \n\n\"bitcoin will sooner or later find its end as well... like everything else.\"\n\nI guess we shall see what happens.

It is true alot of companies are not sure yet how to utilize blockchain effectively, on the other hand there is a significant number of parties that knows perfectly well what to do with said tech. \n\nAn example:\n\nNATO is likely to use a blockchain for data security and data locality. Using a blockchain all NATO members can exchange information with eachother without using central databases, but using a blockchain instead. This means every single NATO country will retain full control over their data and can still use the blockchain record as a single point of truth that is shared by all participants. Obviously the elimination of the trust factor in regard to data security using blockchain tech is a no-brainer, hence they are adopting blockchain technology. \n\nAs for cryptocurrency, yeah, I figure in countries with fairly stable national currencies and a relatively low amount of corruption cryptocurrency adoption for mainstream economic use will be alot slower than in third world countries with despotic regimes suffering from hyperinflation.

Your chargeback comments again are misinformed because you don't understand bitcoin or the technology. \n\nIn Bitcoin the feature you are looking for is called \"escrow\". It can be implemented with multiple-sig (2 of 3) in Bitcoin.\nIn your PayPal example, there is a trusted 3rd party (PayPal.com). Both the sender and receiver trust them to handle disputes, making a human decision to let the receiver keep the money or giving it back to the sender.\n\nBitcoin doesn't have a trusted 3rd party built into the system, but one can be used at any time. This is called escrow.\n\nIn this system, the sender uses multi-sig to send a payment to a destination that needs 2 of 3 signatures to send it to the final destination. the 3 signatures are the sender, the receiver, and the 3rd party (escrow company). The receiver will put the first signature on the transaction that sends the money to himself, but he needs a 2nd signature to receive it. When the sender receives the merchandise in the mail, he can add his signature, which gets the money to the receiver (merchandise seller).\n\nIf the sender (merchandise buyer) does not receive the merchandise, he will open a dispute with the escrow company asking for his money back. If the dispute is resolved in his favor, then he and the escrow company sign a transaction the sends the money back to him.\n\nOn the other hand, if the seller (receiver) does not receive his bitcoin in a reasonable time, he can also open a dispute with the same 3rd party.\n\n&gt;(which is probably why over 1,000,000 bitcoins have been stolen in hacks despite being protected by \"immutable\" cryptography).\n\nSee this just proves you don't know what you're talking about. \n\nWhen have \"over 1,000,000 bitcoins have been stolen in hacks despite being protected by \"immutable\" cryptography\"?\n\nIf you mean bitcoins stolen from Mt. Gox hacks, you're wrong. Bitcoin's cryptography wasn't broken, the centralized exchange was hacked into. Everyone who has ever lost bitcoins in hacks did not control their private keys, which means they didn't own their bitcoins.

It was a really big deal. He said Ramona had said that if Wright doesn\u2019t come out you still have this really smart guy who has made all these patents, who knows all about bitcoin. \u2018Yeah,\u2019 MacGregor said. \u2018You and five hundred other guys who have called today.\u2019\n\n.\n\n&gt; If there was a rat he would have sniffed it out.\n\nThat's terrible evidence. Frauds are most effective in person. O'Hagan has no technical expertise, either. \n\n&gt; So I ask you this. Do you believe the claims in the law suit that Wright / DK had approx 1.1m BTC from mining in the first couple of years of bitcoin's existance?\n\nOf course not. There's no evidence that Kleiman had *anything* to do with bitcoin, and there's [solid evidence](https://blog.wizsec.jp/2018/02/kleiman-v-craig-wright-bitcoins.html) that the bitcoin referenced in the lawsuit belonged to others. \n\nHowever, it's basically a win-win situation for Kleiman's family. There are two cases: Craig is Satoshi or he is not. In the incredibly unlikely scenario where he actually is Satoshi, they have a strong case and will likely collect something substantial, based on the complaint.\n\nEven though he's not actually Satoshi, it's *still* a good idea. To get rid of the lawsuit, Craig would probably have to show evidence that he's *not* Satoshi, and Kleiman's family knows he'd rather not do that (nor would nChain, since they'd immediately lose more credibility and potentially a lot of money). So, it's in *everyone's* interest to settle the case. And if they do settle, Craig supporters will think it's more evidence that he's Satoshi!

Tx's on sidechains are not valid transactions on bitcoin. Every single update of a LN channel is a valid bitcoin tx. You can broadcast this tx to the network if you please. As I said, \n\n&gt; And no, LN is not a sidechain. Its a system of bitcoin tx's that makes it possible to update the one bitcoin tx between two parties without the risk of the other party broadcasting and old bitcoin tx.\n\n&gt; Can you guess who suggested updating bitcoin tx many times without broadcadting the tx to the network?\n\nI have never claimed that you were wrong about how LN works (except its not a sidechain). I have claimed that if your argument is that LN tx are not bitcoin because they are not on-chain, then 0-conf tx are not bitcoin either. This is what I've been saying again and again and again. Call LN whatever you want, that doesn't make 0-conf any more bitcoin if you apply the same argument to 0-conf tx.\n\n&gt; Cross-chain atomic swaps can occur off-chain instantly with heterogeneous blockchain consensus rules. \n\nYes, LN supports atomic swaps also between other blockchains that support it. That does not make LN a sidechain.

What I care about is **only** that your argument is that its not on-chain, and therefore not bitcoin which makes 0-conf not bitcoin too. You are welcome to come with a new definition that suits your needs. This is actually the only thing I'm interested in. We are currently working with *your* argument. And I completely accept, that if we use *your* definition of bitcoin to be \"must be on chain\" then sure, LN would not be bitcoin under that definition (although I don't agree with that definition, but thats another case).\n\nJust one thing about LN.

The worrying factor is that chips are already very very small. \n\n2) Bitcoin cash is way smaller than bitcoin, and not used nearly as much. Look at the block size for recent blocks, and the amount of transactions in them and compare to bitcoin blocks. \n\nNow with the amount of usage, look at the alliance of Jihan, Roger, and CSW.

Read chapter 5 of Mastering Bitcoin", "created_date": 1527071301}, {"comment": "Thank you both u/[Chex0](https://www.reddit.com/user/Chex0) and u/[DistinctSituation](https://www.reddit.com/user/DistinctSituation) for your comprehensive replies. I think both of your arguments are getting at important aspects of Bitcoin's security, but I am of the opinion that your emphasis on non\\-mining full nodes rather than mining nodes is misplaced. Let me try to explain why and perhaps you can tell me what you think.\n\nFirst, on an attack by state\\-level actors\u2014which I think has always been the biggest risk to Bitcoin. There are two way for this to proceed: \\(1\\) a 51&amp;#37; attack on the network, which is why it is important that Bitcoin maintains huge hashing power. In this sense, corporate mining operations and huge energy consumption add to network security. \\(2\\) state actors attempting to shut down the network by force \\(your suggestion\\). But if this is the play then states need not shut down every non\\-mining full node to \"make it unusable for most regular users\". Killing the chain requires only that states shut down the miners\u2014if blocks stop then  the chain is dead. So I'd suggest that protection against state sponsored attacks requires both the maximisation of hashing power \\(to prevent attack 1\\) and a wide geographical distribution of full nodes and mining nodes \\(to prevent attack 2\\), rather than a simple proliferation of non\\-mining full nodes as suggested. \n\nSecond, decentralisation as protection of the immutability of the blockchain. u/[DistinctSituation](https://www.reddit.com/user/DistinctSituation), I think that the way you've framed the issue of at 51&amp;#37; attack requires us to make a distinction between: \\(1\\) an attack that attempts to change the protocol, eg.  changing the mining rewards to \"create Bitcoins out of thin air\", and \\(2\\) dishonestly using the consensus rules, eg. censoring transactions and double spending by re\\-writing the blockchain.\n\nThe reason why it's necessary to distinguish them is because I suspect these different attacks would provoke very different responses from the network. Attack 1 seeks to change the consensus rules by voting with majority hashing power. However, unless this attack is initiated almost unanimously by miners then it will result only in a fork of the blockchain, with a majority chain mining according to the new inflationary rules and a minority according to the old rules. Both chains will, at least in the short term, be viable. However, because it is in no one's interest \\(except  the attackers\\) to use the new consensus rules, all economic activity will be continued on the minority chain. Hence, the miraculous bitcoins appearing on the majority chain will be economically useless. \n\nThe other attack is more complex because there is no clear splitting of the chain according to consensus rules, but only on the basis of disagreements amongst miners about the history of transactions. On this point, I want to challenge your distinction between the immutability of the history and of the future, because I see the blockchain as a machine for establishing the sequence of \\(past\\) events. These events are by definition always in our past and the question is always only \"what happened and when?\". As you've suggested, the blockchain makes it exponentially more difficult to change this historical record the deeper we look back in time. In this respect, the point at which a miner gained majority hashing power is irrelevant to the question of changing the ledger. If the miner wants to alter the history of past transactions then they must re\\-do all of the proof of work from that block onwards, even if they had majority hashing power during this time.\n\nSo, what exactly can dishonest miners achieve with a 51&amp;#37; attack? They can \\(1\\) commit double spending attacks, \\(2\\) censor transactions and thereby destroy Bitcoin's function as peer to peer cash. The former will result in a dramatic loss of confidence in the protocol and a corresponding loss in bitcoin's market value. And the rest of the network would likely respond by waiting for many confirmations before accepting payments. But given that these dishonest miners will destroy their own wealth in the attempt to steal some real\\-world product without \"paying for it\", this doesn't seem like a rational action by someone motivated by economic incentives. The analogy I see is that the biggest corporations *could* easily destroy global capitalism, but they won't, because that would be economically irrational. \n\nOn \\(2\\), my point from the above post was that if we're worried about dishonest miners censoring txs and destroying bitcoin's usability as peer\\-to\\-peer cash, then why aren't we worried about the censoring of transactions that happens in a so\\-called \"fee market\"?\n\nAnyway, sorry, this post is way too long. The way I see it, Bitcoin's security model is based on the assumption that no colluding dishonest miners achieve 51&amp;#37; hashing power. *If* this happens then everything goes out the window, full nodes or not.

Lets get through all the clues first\n\n1. You can throw out at least half of the words in the picture\n2. Think in pairs\n3. Code easily, attack early\n4. Lost transaction costs almost users\n5. 00212121\n6. Try \\+1\n7. Almost open\n8. Bonus clue: To triumph, one must look within. To infinity, and beyond. When you are close to home, X marks the spot. \\(from here\\)\n9. \\-1\n\n**WHAT DOES THIS ALL MEAN???????**\n\n**MY ANSWER:**\n\n**First off**, I think, that the picture does not have the seed words to the bitcoin address. Even if it does, it might not be systemically linked together, rather than scattered across.Second, I think that the whole picture is just a bacground for decoding the private key through **Elliptic Curve Cryptography and the finite \\(prime\\) field.** [LINK](https://medium.com/chain-intelligence/tldr-guide-bitcoin-private-key-public-key-and-public-address-623ad99768c3)\n\nI base my opinion because:\n\n**Second** **clue**: Think in pairs.\n\n&gt;Bitcoins themselves are not stored either centrally or locally and so no one entity is their custodian. They exist as records on a distributed ledger called the block chain, copies of which are shared by a volunteer network of connected computers. *To \"own\" a bitcoin simply means having the ability to transfer control of it to someone else by creating a record of the transfer in the block chain. What grants this ability? Access to an* [*ECDSA*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_Curve_DSA) ***private and public key pair***\\*\\*.\\*\\* What does that mean and how does that secure bitcoin? [LINK](https://www.coindesk.com/math-behind-bitcoin/)\n\nI think the first clue is given as gentle nudge into this direction.\n\n**Third** **clue:** code easily, attack early.Even though all of these words can my acceptable BIP39 words, there is one problem: Attack early is next to each other, and that is ok, but code and easily are seperated quite significantly. How does this help? I think it falls right into the ECDSA theory quite well. These are probably the points on the Elliptic curves, on the  finite \\(prime field\\). **Same thing goes for the fourth, seventh and sixth clue**\n\n**Fifth** **clue**: 00212121\n\nHonestly, I cant remember, but I saw, that an 8 digit number of somesort is also significant to this ECDSA thing, but I honestly cannot find the page I found this.\n\n**Sixth** **and** **ninth** **clue**: Try \\+1, \\-1. Since \\-1 is nowhere to be found on the picture, it reminded me that, that there exists a group law on the set of all points on a given elliptic curve \\(**where \\-1 IS significant**\\). See [LINK1](https://medium.com/chain-intelligence/tldr-guide-bitcoin-private-key-public-key-and-public-address-623ad99768c3) [LINK2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generating_set_of_a_group)\n\n**Eitht** **bonus clue**: To triumph, one must look within. To **infinity**, and beyond. When you are close to home, X marks the spot. It so happens, that **there is also a point of infinity on the ECDSA curve AND on the picture**. [LINK1](https://medium.com/chain-intelligence/tldr-guide-bitcoin-private-key-public-key-and-public-address-623ad99768c3) [LINK2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_at_infinity) [LINK3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic-curve_cryptography)\n\n**These coincidences leave me to believe, that the picture is a an encrypted map of the private key. If so, I believe, that if the picture would be decrypted with the ECDSA curve** ***OR SOMETHING IN THAT NATURE*** **PERHAPS, you could find the private key, or at least come closer to it.**\n\nIf this info was useful to anyone, feel free to donate :\\)\n\n39injGAyZms9YukRvGWuJAtWFu9dFndGoD\n\nGood luck!

Bitcoin use to have instant transactions because once you broadcasted a tx it was guaranteed to get in to the blockchain, thus allowing zero confirmation.  Satoshi wrote: \n\n&gt;I believe it'll be possible for a payment processing company to provide as a service the rapid distribution of transactions with good-enough checking in something like 10 seconds or less.\n\n&gt;The network nodes only accept the first version of a transaction they receive to incorporate into the block they're trying to generate.  When you broadcast a transaction, if someone else broadcasts a double-spend at the same time, it's a race to propagate to the most nodes first.  If one has a slight head start, it'll geometrically spread through the network faster and get most of the nodes.\n\n&gt;A rough back-of-the-envelope example:\n1         0\n4         1\n16        4\n64        16\n80%      20%\n\n&gt;So if a double-spend has to wait even a second, it has a huge disadvantage.\n\n&gt;The payment processor has connections with many nodes.  When it gets a transaction, it blasts it out, and at the same time monitors the network for double-spends.  If it receives a double-spend on any of its many listening nodes, then it alerts that the transaction is bad.  A double-spent transaction wouldn't get very far without one of the listeners hearing it.  The double-spender would have to wait until the listening phase is over, but by then, the payment processor's broadcast has reached most nodes, or is so far ahead in propagating that the double-spender has no hope of grabbing a significant percentage of the remaining nodes.\n\nCore devs broke this functionality by introducing replace by fee and by letting the blocks get full.

I would differentiate between the decentralisation of the network and the usability for its users though. \n\nDecentralisation, as you correctly said, depends on the decentralisation of the blockchain and the mining power.  When the blockchain is not decentralised, then the history cannot be said to be immutable. If the  the mining power isn't decentralised, then the future cannot be said to be immutable. With future I mean that one cannot be certain that transactions added from a certain point on \\(let's say 7 blocks before the mining power became centralised\\) don't create Bitcoins out of thin air. Therefore, the network cannot be trusted from the point on when the mining power becomes centralised. However, the history of the network still can be trusted since it would be very, very, very unfeasible to re\\-create 400k\\+ blocks, but it would be feasible to re\\-create 6 blocks with the majority of the mining power.\n\nMy point here is: Both the history and the future of Bitcoin need protection. The history can be protected by having many independent full\\-nodes that keep their own copy of the blockchain. The history can be protected by keeping the mining power distributed and mining pools independent of each other. \n\nThe rationale behind BTC's \\~4MB blocksize cap is to protect the history of the blockchain. When blocks and the blockchain as a whole become too large for a normal Joe to keep a copy of it, then that normal Joe will stop doing so, and the history becomes more centralised, which threatens its integrity. Hence, by making it less feasible to keep a copy of the blockchain, you threaten the history of Bitcoin and make yourself even more vulnerable to governmental attacks since there are not enough normal Joes left to keep an independent copy of the blockchain that could function as a backup if governments decide to crack down on Bitcoin. It is easy to crack down on a couple of data centers that hold the blockchain, but much harder to crack down on 10k\\+ independent citizens all over the world. \n\nNow, opposite to this rationale is the argument of usability. A user needs to be able to send transactions without delay or excessive fees with which I agree. The question only is, how do you achieve usability and not threaten the history and future of Bitcoin? I don't think that LN is the holy grail, but it might help to take some pressure off the network. I believe there is no single solution to this problem. Increasing the blocksize is definitely part of the solution, but eventually I think there must be a combination of different solutions, some of which you can see now already like incentivising batching.

For instance, a transaction can be written to designate a third party to decide whether it is returned if the payer does not release it, with auto-release after a number of days.  **I'll implement a more basic form of escrow first, but the network infrastructure includes a predicate language that can express any number of options.**\n\n&gt;https://plan99.net/~mike/satoshi-emails/thread2.html\n\nAnd this discussion with Mike Hearn:\n\n&gt;&gt;I haven't fully\nunderstood why sequence numbers are a property of the tx inputs rather\nthan the tx itself.\n\n&gt;**It's for contracts.**  An unrecorded open transaction can keep being replaced until nLockTime.  It may contain payments by multiple parties.  Each input owner signs their input.  For a new version to be written, each must sign a higher sequence number (see IsNewerThan).

Ceteris Paribus, the relationship between treasury bonds and equity markets (stocks, property, cryptos etc) is definitive. In a low interest rate environment, investors flock to assets in search for capital gains. In a high interest rate environment investors pile into debt securities and T-bonds in search for higher yields to maturity. \n\nIMO this moon lambo nonsense is the direct result of low interest rates, and liquidity premium. These coins that have these grandiose visions of a sci-fi future really are just short-term money making operations. It's literally innovation back to front. Generally with innovative digital technology like youtube and facebook etc there is a strong market demand prior to IPO. With cryptocurrency it's the complete opposite - bar a relatively small amount of cryptos with strong use cases. \n\nAnyway, once those yields on bonds spike upwards above 3% possibly towards 20%, equity markets like cryptos, stocks, property etc will collapse (50-80%). This is because the market is under the grand illusion that t-bonds are somehow default risk-free. This will cause a tremendous amount of deflation in the economy, as equity capital is the main source of employment funding. With a massive spike in unemployment central banks will probably begin some sort of giant scale Quantitative easing program (much bigger than we have today) in order to suppress yields and stimulate economic growth through employment and inflation. \n\nQE4 is what will rapidly turn a deflationary economic environment into a hyper-inflationary environment. This will be when the price of cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, bitcoin cash, ethereum etc will absolutely skyrocket to levels we cannot possibly fathom. The other theory that I think has some validity is that deflation, on a scale much worse than the great depression, will cause war and social upheaval that could end up in emancipation of government from central banks, or the two of those things all together. This could lead to the price of bitcoin plummeting to levels towards $200-$500. However, the relative price of goods and services would also plummet far worse and the actual purchasing power of bitcoin could still be maintained through disinflation, especially when people lose ultimate faith in fiat currencies.

Crypto is fiat. Crypto is now worth everything. New developments and technological breakthroughs are happening almost daily \\- courtesy of developers making use of the technology from Golem, Cardano and AI tech like Invacio. Any kind of information you use is stored on the cloud, on Siacoin or Dadi and other similar providers. The biggest companies in the world are now all vested into blockchain, one way or another, working with blockchain giants like Ethereum, VeChain, Neo and Icon, among others. Following the mass adoption of Cryptocurrencies, the entire Crypto market is now valued at 20 Trillion USD.\n\nNow, Smart Contracts make up a significant portion of everything that is going on in the CryptoCurrency Market. With the adoption of new technology comes new security risks. Blockchain crimes done through phishing and hacking are on the rise. But you don't have to worry. People can no longer scam their fellow human beings like could with Fiat. The essential use of Blockchain starting with Bitcoin meant there you're funds would be safe as long as you can keep them safe. Products like Quantstamp remove all kinds ICO scamming by carrying out audits that immediately flag scam projects and remove them from existence. Projects like Pundi X and BABB now take care of your everyday financial needs. There is no longer the need to carry a wallet of any form, just your phone. No credit cards to lose, no physical money to get stolen. Suddenly you feel a pain in your stomach. You visit a new hospital in your area but don't have your medical records on you. Not a problem, since projects like MedicalChain and Shivom are at forefront of the Medical Industry. Your medical records are produced in a jiffy, since they are stored on the blockchain and can be accessed anywhere, anytime by an authorized medical professional. \n\nAnd how can this individual be recognized as an authorized doctor? Well projects like Civic take care of this very problem by keeping a database of all people and their essential information, that are shared in collaboration with other projects to make life seamless. \n\nCryptocurrency has many functions, and being a form of payment is just one of them. It is now the fundamental basis of our society, and we're all the better for it.

[Here's a list of users with commit access.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/5riy1j/list_of_people_who_have_had_commit_access_to/)  It's from last year, so I'm open to receive any updates there.  But it looks to me like there have only ever been two different Blockstreamers with commit access, and never once has it been the lead maintainer.\n\nAnd again, even if the client does get taken over by a group...it doesn't matter.  Anyone can fork the code and create an alternative, and no one can be forced to run code they don't like.\n\n&gt; I think the better criticisms lie with the actual approach and (nonexistant) roadmap. The refusal to hardfork (as has been proven to be completely fucking safe by several other coins at the time) to a larger blocksize (even after many Core developers previously stating and even having such a proposal in the roadmap) produced a contentious hardfork that resulted in two coins (which was the boogeyman bullshit that was used as an excuse of not hardforking) which has hurt bitcoin overall.\n\nOther coins have hardforked, but it hardly seems like an apt comparison, because their networks are only a tiny fraction of the size of Bitcoin's, so it is much easier to build consensus.  Even so, look at what happened with BCH...20% of full nodes were forked off the network, and that even includes some miners.\n\nAside from that, I can understand if someone disagreed with the decision not to hardfork a blocksize increase.  If someone says \"I think we should scale on-chain, so I prefer BCH\", then I can respect.  I think it's a poor decision, but I don't really have a problem with someone deciding that for themself.\n\n&gt; The kicking the can down the road approach is perfectly valid when your 2nd layer is still not yet ready for mainstream use. There is now less utilization of the base layer than before but still extremely fucking terrible user experience with mempool spikes and resultant fees.\n\nThe mempool spikes and high fees are not ideal, I agree.  But if you want to accurately portray our position, it is worth mentioning that we see that as the lesser of two evils - the greater evil being the loss of decentralization by raising the cost of validating the chain (as well as other centralizing effects).\n\nIf you can understand that we don't think the increase in throughput is worth the negative effects, then it should be understandable how we would forgo a hardforked blocksize increase, even if 2nd layer tech isn't ready yet.\n\n&gt; Bitcoin has now the lowest historical marketshare of the cryptospace as a direct fucking result of the absolute refusal to budge one fucking inch. If it had done so, there would not have been a split and neither would there have been a crashing of marketshare.\n\nIn order for me to agree that this is a valid argument, I'd need to be convinced of these two things:\n\n- marketcap is an accurate measure of a coin's usefulness/success.\n- the rise of altcoins wouldn't have happened without Bitcoin's blocksize debate.\n\nI don't see any reason to believe either of those.

If the IRS were going around reporting drug dealers to the FBI or DEA, then nobody would report their drug money and pay taxes on it. The IRS WANTS everyone to report their income and pay their taxes, so it would behoove them to make the reporting of and tax paying on crypto as accessible as possible. \n\nObviously that is nothing short of a shit show right now, and you are correct in saying that the govt and banks don't want people adopting crypto.

However, I recall that (from second hand sources / bitcointalk) a few things, which I was trying to re-verify what I recall. If my memory and the source was correct:\n\n1) There were no more than three people that had access to an alert system that was built within Bitcoin, but was eventually removed. Gavin was one of the people that had access to this alert system. \n\n2) The Bitcoin software was not originally on a version control hub, but Gavin eventually set that up. I looked into the Github to see if there was history there, but I am not sure Github was even the first version control system used, nor was there a clear history who was involved that early that I could find. I mean, it seems to be there, but did not look easy to extract.\n\n3) There was a lot of hearsay that Satoshi left after Gavin went to the CIA, but now that I look into it, his disappearance seems more closely aligned with the Wikileaks accepting Bitcoin announcement. At least his public messages seemed to stop. Maybe someone sees something different? \n\nAgain, I don't think Satoshi would have declared Gavin to be the king of the code, but he might have just left him to be the only one with \"keys.\" Gavin did make many commits early on and seems to be very humble. One of his first acts was to distribute the commit access. Again, don't take my word for it.

And the profit must be noticeable, that the users really feel that crypto is an improvement of their financial situation. If you are poor, than every cent counts. It's easy to write, with an Apple X in your hand, BCH is created for the poor in Africa or Asia. But than most of the people forget the practical implementation. For a trusted payment, the customer need a connection to the network for make a payment, and the merchant need a connection to the network for control there was a payment. The poor people go to the market. How can they pay in BCH? Outside the big cities, you are already very lucky when you can find a GSM/Edge network. Maybe the customer can give the merchant a paper wallet. But what is than advantage if you compare with cash? Nobody will accept paper wallet as payment if there is cash. And imagine that the people have a phone, and a wallet, and BCH, and data/SMS connection,they only will use it if the price is cheaper than what they have to pay in FIAT. They never will use it, when they have to pay even 1 cent more than FIAT price. And my opinion is than, use the BCH marketing budget for help these people to use crypto. Why pay an pizza restaurant in Europe or USA some BCH if they will accept BCH. Better invest this money to create a payment provider, who create the same, or best, a cheaper price, than FIAT. Or invest the marketing budget in technology for the poor, the extremely cheap smartphone, or free communications provider. I wish to send money to my friend in Manilla.

These tokens are not called Bitcoin. The Bitcoin tokens did not need to be recovered. For Bitcoin it was all business as usual. Two separate paths were not created on  August 1st, only one separate path was created. Bitcoin Cash forked away from the original chain.  Bitcoin remained Bitcoin on its original path aka original chain. Business as usual.    \nBecause these are separate tokens they have separate tickers. BCH is the ticker symbol representing Bitcoin Cash. BTC is the ticker symbol representing Bitcoin.  \nPutting BCH next to the word Bitcoin is misleading because BCH is the ticker symbol representing Bitcoin Cash.   \n\n&gt;Not saying it will happen, but if one day BTC stopped being mined altogether, and BCH became the only dominate fork, would it be strange to you if the community stopped adding the word Cash, and just started to call it Bitcoin?\n&gt;     \n\nIt's reasonable to assume people are going to shorten or abbreviate long names.

Now its encouraging to see the buying support coming in from large volume buyers. It seems traders in general now see 7.8K as titanium support and are reacting in the way you would expect them to, with futures traders being very much in bulltardation mode, with futures premiums seemingly rising after dips. If you're a trader this is where you cover your short and take profit, around 7.9K or consider whether to long. But its basically nothing but air between 7.8 and 7.2 now so be very careful.\n\nPersonally I see no reason to change my long term views after concensus and I'll keep my exposure limited to 2 BTC until we reach much lower levels.\n\nHappy gambling y'all", "created_date": 1527034291}, {"comment": "**Bitcoin (BTC) Basic Info:** [Website](https://bitcoin.org) - r/Bitcoin - [Abstract](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoWikis/wiki/Bitcoin_basicinfo#wiki_short_description) - [History](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoWikis/wiki/Bitcoin_basicinfo#wiki_history) - [Exchanges](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoWikis/wiki/Bitcoin_basicinfo#wiki_exchanges) - [Wallets](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoWikis/wiki/Bitcoin_basicinfo#wiki_wallets) \n\n**Biases:** [Arguments For](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoWikis/wiki/Bitcoin_pros) &amp; [Arguments Against](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoWikis/wiki/Bitcoin_cons) | **CryptoWikis:** [Policy](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/wiki/policy#wiki_cryptowikis_program_-_.28work_in_progress.29) - [Contribute Content](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoWikis/wiki/contributing)\n\n---\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

There was nothing stopping people from running full reserve banks, they're just terribly uncompetitive compared to fractional reserve banks so few people used or tried to set one up. \n\nWithout fractional reserves banks make far less money, which means they charge higher fees and don't give out interest (since they can't lend your money out to make money on it), and realistically maybe 1 customer in 10,000 cares enough about a once in a century risk of a bank run enough to pay higher fees for 50 years.\n\nThe only thing stopping fractional reserves from existing is government regulation, otherwise you can always write a contract saying \"yes you can loan my money out to people in return for interest\". although with hardcore rothbardian types easing of regulations on fractional reserves is ironically seen as some sort of government imposition on sound money.\n\nThere's no reason Bitcoin won't have just as many fractional reserves as Gold, or just as many runs as gold fractional reserves did. more so in absence of a central authority to help bail out those reserves .

Rather that they include what is, in effect, an attack on anyone trying to remain behind on the old rule set. Consider the converse and note that \"51% attacks\" are really just malicious soft forks. What are all of the bad things that a malicious entity with a majority of the hash power can do? Well, they can facilitate double spends. But that's equivalent to a soft fork that begins to enforce the following rule: \"*actually* transaction B came before transaction A.\" They can freeze out other miners: \"only the blocks that I mine are valid.\" They can blacklist addresses: \"tx's from the following addresses are invalid.\" They can even shut down transaction processing entirely(!): \"in order to be valid, a block must be completely empty.\" You're thinking about soft forks that, from your perspective, simply add a new, optional-to-use transaction type and asking how that can be considered to include a \"51% attack.\"  Well because you might think that the protocol change is a harmful one and prefer to use a chain that doesn't include it. But in order to do so and avoid being swept along with the (in-your-eyes) harmful change, you'll need to coordinate your own fork.\n\n&gt;In the case that a hash rate majority attempt a hard fork, they only hard fork themselves away from the chain economic activity. \n\nWell no, that's only likely to be the case in a bizarre scenario where the hash rate majority makes some obviously-malicious change via hard fork (e.g., lifting the 21 million coin supply cap). And a malicious hash rate majority is very unlikely to attack the chain via a hard fork given that a soft fork attack is so much more devastating. But if we assume the incentive system that is the heart of the Bitcoin invention is working properly, the hash rate majority should only be attempting to mine a chain (or chains) with features that they think investors want. And in general, there IS a very strong incentive for users to rush to follow the miners given the strength of the most-PoW chain as a Schelling point and the overwhelming importance of the network effect.\n\n&gt;Miners would not attempt to hard fork without also attempting a social attack to convince users to convert to their chain. This is basically what Bitcoin Cash is.\n\nThis strikes me as a strange interpretation of events.  If miners think a particular course of action is in Bitcoin's best interests, then it makes sense for them to try to convince other investors that's the case. I see the BTC chain as being the victim of a \"creeping 51% attack.\" Obviously if tomorrow a majority of the BTC hashrate began orphaning any blocks larger than 1-kb, thereby rendering the network essentially unusable, we would rightly identify that as a \"51% attack.\" Well, keeping the 1-MB limit in place as it becomes increasingly inadequate in the face of rising transactional demand ultimately gets you to the same place. \n\n&gt;If miners attempted a 51% attack, the worst damage they could do is double-spend some transactions of people who didn't wait for multiple confirmations, and cause some minor denial of service by mining for example, empty blocks. \n\nIf miners attempted a 51% attack, the worst damage they could do would completely destroy the market's confidence in, and the usability of, the chain they attacked. The relatively modest \"creeping 51% attack\" on BTC already produced a pretty nasty situation in December with really ugly persistent backlogs and average tx fees that spiked briefly to over $50.  If the hash rate majority decided to *really* attack that chain via repeated reorgs and/or empty-block attacks, they could effectively kill it pretty damn quickly. \n\n&gt; but it's clear from Bitcoin Cash that social attacks are not the most effective way on-board a majority of users - it doesn't matter if you're right or wrong about which chain to move to if you can't get the support of the majority.\n\nAgain, I think that calling Bitcoin Cash a \"social attack\" is silly. I see it as a desperate attempt to route around the social attack the BTC is falling victim to. But it's certainly far from ideal and represents, in my eyes, at least a partial failure of the incentive system. The mining majority should have done a clean upgrade of Bitcoin network to increase its capacity. Instead, we got a rebranded hash-rate minority \"spinoff\" that was forced to make wallet-breaking changes to its transaction format and DAA, essentially forcing that chain to restart its commercial network effect from scratch. BCH by the very nature of how it was created was put at a HUGE disadvantage relative to the incumbent chain. \n\n", "created_date": 1527022974}, {"comment": "One look at the dudes twitter explains it all.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/ncweaver?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\n\nHes just hard core liberal \"intelectual\" that is full of himself, like krugman.

All Bitcoin really needs to do transactions is a two computers who runs the software \\(well we could go by even with one computer, but that wouldn't be much of a network then\\). That could deliver easily current transaction speeds and much more. However, to fuck up the network is now only needed three computers \\(or just two more powerful\\). But because you get more bitcoins from successfully getting right answer to a cryptographical algorithm, people throw more computing power to them and difficulty of the algorithm is adjusted automatically to keep blocks appearing on same 10min rate on average. Because of that, the energy Bitcoin consumes follows slowly its price. Because of that, you need to waste energy usage of Ireland \\(\\+ all the equipment, which probably means several billions even in scenario where you get them by manufacturing costs\\) if you want to do something shady, like 51&amp;#37; attack \\(assuming none of the current hashpower is yours\\).\n\nSo while clueless people are thinking \"oh damn, Bitcoin is using energy of Ireland to do 3 transactions per second\", developers are thinking \"Great, Bitcoin is getting even more harder to crack\".", "created_date": 1527021604}, {"comment": "Vin recently appeared on Bitcoin Car Talk.

I have personally used it and had no issues yet but if some of what they say about it is true it could all collapse instantly and hopefully I wont be holding it at the time. What I don't understand is some people claim it has no use even if it was legit. The only reasons I have used it is to day trade or more accurately make trades in attempts to make some type of gain. For example selling say bitcoin at a high then buying it back at a low and using USDT as the currency to hold my money so it does not change in value. Its quick and easy plus the way I see it in my opinion it should not be a taxable event. I could be wrong and even if I'm right the government may not care and still come for that money but I think you have an argument with converting to USDT as being a not taxable event vs converting to USD. If you convert to USD its locking in the profit in dollars and would be taxable. By converting to USDT you are just converting to another crypto and have not locked in any profit and whatever value you gained at that moment could change at any time.
