But all the LN hubs people are used to using can say \"we're shutting down your old channels and refunding your BTC, but you can get right back on to LN as you know it by funding a new channel (let's call it a \"Lightning 2.0\" channel) with us. Given the choice of using the now super-congested BTC network they aren't accustomed to using regularly and simply \"upgrading\" to \"Lightning 2.0\" channels, what will most users do?\n\nI agree with you that *if* Lightning could *independently* maintain an equal or similar level of decentralization and security as the base chain, then it would be as secure from this kind of tampering and coercion as the base chain. But I have seen [pretty convincing arguments](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGrUOLsC9cw&amp;t=1s) that this is impossible. Moreover, if it were possible, what would even be the point of the base layer? The whole argument, as I understand it, is that the base layer provides security and decentralization, while the 2nd layer provides scale. If the 2nd layer by itself were as secure and decentralized as the 1st and can also scale, what even is the point of the 1st?\n\nI'm skeptical that small blocks with lots of user nodes will ultimately be more decentralized and censorship resistant than big blocks with lots of miner power all over the world, but for the sake of argument, let's say that, in terms of decentralization and censorship resistance BTC&gt;BCH&gt;LN *by itself* (if you actually think LN will be inherently more decentralized and censorship resistant *on its own* than bitcoin with big blocks, then I could agree it would probably be a better way to scale, but that's a whole different conversation related to the above link).\n\nIn this case (BTC&gt;BCH&gt;LN at scale) BCH is still a less risky way to scale than BTC+LN, because I don't think it makes sense to say that \"LN relies on BTC for its security and decentralization; therefore, it's as secure as BTC itself.\" My whole point is that that's how it is designed to be *now*, but that design is more vulnerable to being tampered with or rewritten than the BCH main chain. It won't matter that, under the old design, LN channel credits were as good as BTC if the government has the power to force the main channel providers to kick users off those old channels, but with the option to start using their new, \"Lightning 2.0,\" (and, again, what choice will they have? Everybody just go back to using the now super-expensive and slow main chain that can't handle anything close to the volume people have grown to expect is possible with LN?).", "Date": 1528089057}, {"text": "strange BTC sell wall in 7680 to 7690 range on binance... about $1 mio...

To answer the one question I do know how to answer, you surround something in * for italics and ** for bold.  There is a formatting help link next to the submit post button that gives you a lot of useful reddit-post tips - it's usually available on the sidebar of most mobile apps too.\n\nNow, for the tougher question.  Because LN transactions are a form of smart contract on the BTC blockchain, they're subject to all the consensus rules of that blockchain, plus a few additional rules defined by the BOLT protocol.  Because of this, LN (like segwit) is completely optional for the end user.  If you didn't believe in these solutions, but still wanted to use the BTC blockchain, you can still do so using different transaction formats (such as the traditional P2PKH, or the myriad P2SH formats, such as multisig or even something of your own design).  There are already discussions about how to enable any BTC address to send and receive directly from an LN address without needing to open an LN channel first.  This is very important because it means you do not get excluded from the network if 99.999% of the world adopts LN but you do not or can not do so.  Now, to be clear, I don't think any of this last part has made it out of the discussion/design phase, but it's important to remember that LN is still very much beta software, so I don't expect it to be anywhere near feature-complete in its current form.\n\nLet me see if I can address some of your points directly:\n\n&gt; That explains why it may be impossible to directly steal BTC value of EXISTING LN channels or add more funds than one has to EXISTING LN channels. But what stops someone with enough power and influence over hub operators and devs from creating a new kind of contract, also built on the BTC chain (at least initially), but not redeemable in the same way, or redeemable only under certain, restrictive conditions?\n\nThis is exactly the same as coming up with a brand-new protocol.  It is impossible for this new protocol to affect the already existing channels without those channel owners actively closing out their channels and *choosing* to use the new one.  The key here is choice.  It cannot be forced onto anyone just like a change to the consensus rules cannot be forced onto anyone.  Remember that all of this is open source, peer-reviewed code.  Nobody will accept a closed-source transaction format in the same way that nobody will accept a closed-source wallet.  You simply can't make a change like the one you're describing without the entire world noticing and opting out of whatever \"FED-ning\" Network you're trying to create.\n\n&gt; Suppose LN hubs have centralized to a not extreme but not insignificant degree in the US at some point in the future. Let's say the majority of LN transactions go through one of 1000 hubs, most of which are connected to major, well-known companies (that is, the government can fine them, take them to court, etc.).\n\nI would argue this is the same thing as the centralization of fully-validating nodes in BTC or BCH.  In fact, you should also be worried that the \"fewer and fewer\" nodes envisioned by Satoshi and embraced by BCH would share a similar concern.  What happens if a government coerces node owners to change the consensus rules?  Well, that's easy.  Bitcoin (BTC or BCH) is borderless, as well as a million other things; but let's focus on just that one for a moment.  Borderless means that it does not answer to any one jurisdiction, so even if the US Gov could coerce all US-based Nodes to comply with its demands they cannot affect any nodes hosted in any other territories.  The exact same thing is true for any LN node.\n\nFor fun, let's examine the worst-case Hub-and-Spoke scenario: All payments are routed through exactly 1 master hub.  This might look something like the following:\n\n             C\n             |\n    A ----- HUB ----- B\n             |\n             D\n\nIn the above network, any payment from one individual to another individual *must* go through the central hub.  So, let's imagine that Big Brother manages to seize control of the HUB and shuts it down.  What happens?  Well, for one each of the users will basically be forced to close out the channel that they had with the HUB to unlock their BTC.  The HTLC (Hashed Time-Lock Contract) smart contracts that LN is based on are trustless, so, in essence, they're designed specifically to protect users in this type of situation (an adversarial channel partner).  Each user broadcasts to the network the final state of their respective channels to the network and after the previously agreed upon timeframe, their BTC is back in their pocket completely unharmed.  This is very important to understand.  Even in the worst-case scenario, users with a connection to a compromised node are simply inconvenienced, they never lose their BTC (in fact, they may gain some BTC if their channel partner tries to cheat and lie about the balances in the channel).  Additionally, no new BTC can be created or destroyed because even in this doomsday scenario, the closing of a channel is just a regular old BTC transaction, validated by every node on the network.  These users, along with all of the other users in the world, are then free to open new LN channels with each other and the system resumes functioning.  Or, they can abandon the LN and stick with pure on-chain transactions or even some other L2 solution that has not been invented yet.\n\n&gt; The mission: change the fundamental design of LN or create a new \"LN\" functionality that makes it possible for the federal government to open \"LN channels\" (of a sort previously impossible to create) for more \"BTC credit\" than it actually holds BTC at any one time. The design will be such that, initially at least, anyone transacting with the government can still close these \"channels\" (which will actually differ in nature from the original LN channels by allowing one channel to \"cover\" another, but the general public will not understand this distinction) and withdraw the appropriate number of BTC at any time. If necessary, users will be required by the major node operators to close out their \"old,\" 100% BTC-backed LN channels and \"upgrade\" to the new type of channel, since the old channels are \"incompatible\" with the new, government-sanctioned channels.\n\nI believe the above commentary has shown why a mission such as this is impossible.  LN transactions **are** BTC transactions, so they cannot do anything which violates the BTC consensus rules.  Using the LN is optional, so even if you did find a way to shut it down, everyone who was using it can just go back to plain old base-layer transactions, and none of their BTC is ever lost or otherwise compromised.  A government cannot change the rules of the LN for the same reasons that a government cannot change the fundamental consensus rules of any crypto currency.", "Date": 1528084229}, {"text": "Thanks fir explaining in a clear manner that maybe sunk into his brain.

Not just figuratively, had a good laugh when I read your post.\n\n&gt;\"argument from authority\"\n\nI suspected you'd throw that in my face. Except it's not... because I offered the real argument above. I described my argument in detail above, so I'm allowed to bring in people who agree with me.\n\nBut I like that you're admitting the role of full nodes...\n\n&gt;The problem with your reasoning -- and the way Garzik expresses himself in the above citation -- is that you overemphasize nonmining clients to the point that hashpower means nothing and having as well as setting your own nodes consensus rule means everything.\n\nSee, I never said it means \"nothing\". But it means A LOT more than this sub, in general, and you in particular seem to acknowledge. It's obvious that mining power is necessary to extend the chain and time-stamp txs, nobody ever denied that. But the key role non-mining nodes have is to answer \"Who keeps the miners honest?\" In other words, what's to prevent miners to increase the money supply? Because if miners can increase the money supply as they wish, that's central banking 2.0. So what prevents that? Keep in mind, they ALL benefit from it - It's not like only some miners would benefit. So what keeps them in check? Fully validating nodes.\n\nThis is the essence of Jeff's quote above - If nodes collectively refuse your blocks, you can't do anything. And yes, it's true that the network will slow down, that's undeniable and not controversial. But the key point to note is that miners **don't get paid** for blocks that are not relayed, because they don't extend the chain. And that's the flip side of \"what keeps miners honest\" - It's money, not goodwill, like many here claim.\n\nIt then becomes a race - Who can sustain the stubbornness for longer. Full nodes ort miners? The former are running RasPis @ $10/mo (my personal estimated cost), or miners paying ~$2,000/bitcoin in electricity and other costs. What do you think?\n\nThe analogy here is US accountants starting to do taxes according to Canadian rules. The IRS won't accept them, and clients won't pay them. Who do you think will cave first, the US economy or the accountants, with families to support??\n\n&gt;It doesn't work like that. The network is run by doing all of the above. Nonmining nodes can be set up in the thousands and still be worthless except to whoever thinks they gain value by setting them up.\n\nI think I cleared the interaction between mining and non-mining nodes above.\n\n&gt;Yet again you presume too much.

Your point only makes sense if people know the future. Nobody does. Maybe your $100k price point is a terrible time to spend it because maybe shortly after you spend a bunch of bitcoin at $100k it goes to $500k all of a sudden, or maybe it never reaches that price point at all so you're left losing value while waiting for a price that never happens. And everybody's goal price is different, because nobody knows the future.\n\nYeah if it were to go to $1 million and you sold it all you will miss out on lots of gains sure. But that is IF! Nobody knows the future. Nobody knows how high it will end up going or when the best time to sell or spend is. Its just each person's individual choice. If you had sold or spent some of it at $19k in december that would have been a fantastic time to spend it because then you could just rebuy all that bitcoin now for less than half the price.\n\nIf a reality where we don't know what the future is, which is the only reality that exists, there is no \"waiting for it to moon\" because \"moon\" is different for everybody. People wait until it has appreciated enough where they are happy to start spending it. That is the only choice to make. There's no guarantee that Bitcoin becomes the world's reserve currency, so simply holding indefinitely isn't necessarily the best move. Generally people want to hedge their bets.\n\nFor instance I plan on selling some of my Bitcoin around $75k because I think that is a good price point goal for the next couple of years, and doing that will give me enough to set up a nice diversified retirement account. I'm not going to not sell any of it then just in the hope that it keeps going up. I'll have hit a goal price (one of my own personal \"moon\" prices) and so I'm ready to cash out some. And if it goes higher later I'll still have plenty left to cash out or to spend. But if I had bought a few hundred bitcoin back when it was like $50, maybe my goal price would have been $10k and I'd be perfectly happy spending my Bitcoin now.\n\nLike I already explained, people don't know the future, so there is no guaranteed price point \"moon\" that all we have to do is wait and then that'll be the perfect time to start spending our bitcoin. Every person is going to spend at different price points, regardless or what the unforeseeable future holds precisely because it is unforeseeable.\n\nLet's just summarize:\nIt is useful to spend your bitcoin when you are happy with what you have made from bitcoin. Period. For some people that might have been $1000. For some people that might be right now. For some people $100k. For some people $1 million. Every one is different. Since we all bought in at different times, all have different goals for how much money we want to make, and all have different goals for what we want to spend the money on, any price point can be a good time for people to spend Bitcoin, depending on those factors.

There is no such thing as an \"IOU Token\" in BTC or LN, and if you believe that there is then I suspect the remainder of this post will fail to resonate with you, but unfortunately I do not have the time right now to refute that belief.

I'm speaking mostly about the Minimum Competetive Fee issue that I've discussed at some length in this sub before, but there are some other concerns for which I have not yet developed a level of understanding necessary to feel comfortable commenting on at this time.  To be sure, I fully understand that BTC has exactly the same problem and that BTC will be forced to come to grips with that issue much sooner due to the smaller blocks.\n\nLN aims to solve both the block space and the fee issue in \"one fel swoop.\" However, as you agree, LN adds a great deal of complexity to the system, and crypto is already complex enough as it is.  It makes a lot of grandiose claims, and I do not know if it will be able to live up to all of them once the system achieves something like 30% network effect or more.  Based on my personal experiences, and things such as the fact that LN does not specify a routing algorithm, so different wallet vendors are not locked into a single implementation, grant me great optimism for the future of LN, but I remain skeptical while the system is in \"beta.\"\n\nI do apologize if I gave the impression that I was promoting the system to anyone, my intent was simply to clarify some of the misinformation that is often thrown around in this and other threads on this sub.  I will not deny that I believe it is a viable **idea**, but I do not yet know if it is a viable **implementation**, if you understand what I'm saying.  Similarly, I also believe that pure on-chain-only scaling is a viable **idea**, but reserve judgment on if BCH is a viable **implementation** of that idea.  I support both, and do not believe that they are mutually-exclusive approaches.  Hell, the LN whitepaper itself even states that a successful LN would require larger blocks on the main chain.\n\nInsofar as complexity goes, every single crypto-currency to date is more complicated than fiat, so I do not consider that to be a viable comparison.  Consider the difference between the ease of using Venmo compared to setting up and securing your own HD wallet.  This is purely a UX issue, and will be solved in time.

The real reason for the year long ICO was to make as much profit as possible and to allow behind the scenes accumulation. Block.One has officially stated that ICO proceeds are all profit. The vast majority of this money will not be going to development of the platform (unlike most ICOs which at least use the ICO to fund development - not line the owner's pockets). I hope Dan and his father Stan end up in jail for flaunting Securities laws. I hope you all know Stan Larimer was behind the AriseBank scam. Look it up. \n\nhttps://medium.com/@arnold_90210/stan-larimer-and-michael-taggart-actively-promoted-arise-bank-see-multiple-posts-on-medium-b11a1b34be57\n\nhttps://medium.com/@arnold_90210/stan-larimer-and-michael-taggart-actively-promoted-arise-bank-see-multiple-posts-on-medium-b11a1b34be57\n\nBlock.one, Dan Larimer, and Dan's father have been selling ETH constantly and buying up a large percentage of all circulating EOS behind the scenes. The reason for doing this is twofold. dPOS systems will always devolve into a couple of cartels holding a majority/controlling amount of the tokens because of the intrinsic financial incentive to do so. Tokens in a dPOS system have not only their base trading value (the amount a token can be sold for on Binance at any given time) but an additional value in the equity they represent in the Block Producer positions. The block producer spots are the most valuable thing in the EOS ecosystem by far and are the main benefactors of the annual inflation (after 30+ years there will be far more coins created through inflation than exist right now. The current supply will be a drop in the bucket so you can see how important/powerful these BP spots are. 5% annual inflation). Small and medium holders of EOS tokens will never realize any of this BP equity - they simply have no shot of ever becoming producers. They may receive a small kick back from a BP for their vote is all. A large portion of the value in the EOS token will be wasted on most holders. As the large holders accumulate/control more tokens the value of their tokens rise collectively and exponentially (rather than linearly as would be the case with token accumulation of for example BTC) because they will realize an increasing amount of the BP equity from their holdings. Eventually cartels form that hold so many tokens that they can always vote themselves in, act with relative impunity, and never be displaced by opposing parties and at this point the cartel is realizing 100% of their token's BP equity because the cartel owns the block producer spots and gathers all of the block rewards (without having to distribute portions of the rewards for support).\n\nSo you see here the flaw with dPOS and why the economics dictate that tokens will pool into huge individual groups over time in order to maximize their value/utility for the holder. The Larimer Gang knows this. They have seen what has happened with other dPOS projects like LISK and even their own creations Bitshares and STEEM. Dan knows the only way to prevent this is to basically beat everyone else to the punch. Dan himself is accumulating a controlling share of EOS tokens. This way he can control the BP spots himself or at least prevent anyways else from gaining undue influence. He will be able to maintain a semblance of decentralization while controlling EOS from behind the scenes.\n\nBTW, The year long ICO wasn't created to prevent cartels from forming. That is nonsense. Cartels form over time because of the dPOS incentive system; they aren't just made by single groups buying a ton out of the intial ico supply. Initial distribution in the dPOS case doesn't even matter much because while a more even distribution may slow the formation of cartels it will not prevent it because the flow of tokens over time will be the same either way; they will aggregate into large single holdings where their value is maximized. If token x is worth more to person A than to Person B, then x will tend to flow from B to A over time. Simple as that. The reason for the year long ICO is so that Block.One and Dan can more easily disguise their own accumulation. It doesn't matter to them what the cost of the EOS token is because they are buying using the ICO ETH. The more EOS costs during any given phase of the ICO the more ETH they gain during that period to offset the rising cost. They can buy the same amount of EOS each round no matter the price without ever digging into their own pockets. They are the only participant that is unaffected by the rising costs over time in this style ICO making it much easier for them to accumulate a large stake than for other interested parties.", "Date": 1528066409}, {"text": "I think 5-10 years is very optimistic to say you will be set forever given that its coming on 10 years.

Most pre-2020 investors are filthy rich now, fiat is still used in some places and for paying taxes, but the vast majority of commerce is done in crypto. LN has become everything it was promised to be and has gained massive worldwide adoption. Most of the early BTC users are still running their own fully-validating nodes and cheering for decentralization. The on-chain fees are massive, but noone really cares about it, since it's rare for a normal user to transact on-chain. On-chain tx is only used for onboarding someone to LN, and the poorer users who cannot afford even a single on-chain fee use centralized but time-proven trustworthy services to hold their funds and allow them to transact on LN. Meanwhile, BCH chain has also been thriving equally well. The value of BCH is about the same as the value of BTC. Everyone on BCH side is transacting on-chain with low fees and BCH blocks are measured in many gigabytes. Because of resource requirements, BCH nodes are mostly run by miners, exchanges and other large businesses, and rich BCH enthusiasts, the rest using either SPV nodes or. BCH is still being ridiculed by BTC users as  a centralized miner-controlled coin. Who knows what's even going on in their chain, almost noone is validating it.\n\nBlock halvening has just occured and the new coinbase for both BTC and BCH is 0.78125 BTC/BCH per block. But there is a problem. The total amount of block reward for miners on BTC chain is ~2 BTC, fees included. 2 BTC at year 2032 price levels is a huge amount indeed, but the block reward on BCH with it's huge centralized blocks averages 4-5 BCH. This means that the majority of SHA256 miners are mining BCH. Some very trusted Bitcoin Core developers put out a serious PSA \u2014 Jihan Wu controlled mining cabal is controlling more than 100% of BTC hashrate, currently mining on BCH chain. They raise the concern that Jihan Wu has been a long-time enemy of BTC and already tried to destroy BTC 14 years ago. Now they have the means to do that at any point by performing an attack on BTC, compromising any LN channel settlement they wish, even ones that were buried under many blocks. This is a huge risk not only to on-chain BTC, but also to LN. The trustworthy developers announce that, after long discussions and weighing of all the risks, they propose to remove LN dependency from on-chain settlement. Many people object, but the vast majority understand that, even though they would prefer not to do that, it is the lesser of two evils. Risking a complete wipeout of any settlement transactions at any time at Jihan's will, is far more risky for a globally-adopted payment network, than removing the on-chain layer. Other options were considered, such as changing the PoW, but that only postpones the problem \u2014 if one entity could control so much hashpower once, it can in time happen again with different PoW. Yet other options were considered, but upon deeper inspection, also contained serious potential flaws or threats to decentralization. Besides, only the settlement layer is being removed, people rarely have to use it anyway. If anything, it makes BTC better, since now we won't have to spend to pay those pesky miners their huge settlement fees to onboard new users \u2014 a different, free way is proposed to onboard new users. The LN is still BTC and no additional LN tokens are being created, so the supply is still limited, right? Right. For now.. Well, we might just recreate the BTC tokens that have been long lost, are not on LN, and haven't been used for 12 years, since they won't be able to be used on a non-existing chain anyway. But just that..\n\nI think I have another different hypothetical scenario, but I have to think about it and it is way too late here to type it out now.", "Date": 1528061409}, {"text": "I'll give you an example, but let me preface it with this (very) long intro:\n\nBitcoin as per it's original design is a relatively simple and easy-to-understand design. It might not be trivial to understand for everyone on the planet, but for anyone with some technological and economic understanding, it's relatively simple to read the whitepaper and understand the details, incentives, and economics of the system. The current economic system, on the other hand, is deliberately complex and hard to understand. This is intentional, because the less people understand the details, the easier it is for its controllers to implement mechanisms to siphon off some funds, for example in the form of fractional reserve banking, and do this without massive protests by the laypeople they are effectively robbing. I'll call these controlling entities and their partners \"The Powers That Be\" (TPTB), and actually, with regards to the argument I'm making, it doesn't matter if TPTB are the same that are controlling fiat system, or a different group, but I think there is no doubt that there are many powerful entities that want to control Bitcoin and extract value from it for themselves at the expense of everyone else.\n\nBitcoin is a bad system for TPTB for many reasons, and one of these reasons is it's relative simplicity. You can't easily implement in this system something that would benefit you at the expense of others, because most users understand the system and will protest your proposed change.\n\nEnter SegWit. SegWit makes Bitcoin more complex. Not by a huge margin, since the main change can be written in one sentence \"separate signatures out of transactions and store them alongside the transcation block\". But Bitcoin with SegWit is undoubtedly more complex than Bitcoin without SegWit. It also introduces some other slight changes such as fee discount for SegWit trancations. It being a soft-fork also makes it have more complex code than it would have been, had it been a hard-fork. But it's all good, right? Even if it's a bit more complex, most people have at least rudimentary understanding of what it does, many smart Bitcoiners still understand all its details, and the benefits far outweight the costs, since it fixes transaction malleability, enables further implementations like Lightning Network, all while avoiding a risky hard-fork and without compromising ordinary users ability to run non-mining full nodes.\n\nNow add Lightning Network. It's a really smart idea promising cheap, instant peer-to-peer payments off-chain, with potentially unlimited scaling potential, while still requiring all funds to be cryptographicaly backed by BTC and unrevokably tied to the main chain on a 1-to-1 basis. A magnificent solution to the scaling problem, which promises to not only solve scaling, but even make Bitcoin better. Sub-cent fees. No more waiting for confirmations.\n\nBut again, this makes the whole system more complex, much more than SegWit in this case. The sheer size of LN whitepaper already says a lot about it's complexity. As proof, I invite you to read and fully understand the original Bitcoin whitepaper and code, then SegWit BIPs and code, then LN whitepaper and code. If you understand Bitcoin along with it's technical and economical implications, you are smart. If you can say the same about Bitcoin with SW, you are very smart. But you fully grasp LN along with it's technical details and economic impact on users, miners, businesses and economy, I humbly raise my hat to you because you are a member of a very exclusive club. But even if you do, I guarantee that there are some details, some implications, some edge cases that you missed in this whole BTC+SW+LN system. Not because you would be dumb, but because it's impossible to understand everything in such a complex system.\n\nMore complexity is good for TPTB. It means there are many more potential approaches, and it means fewer people will understand your motives. Once they find a potential vector to seaze control and siphon some value out of the system, they can start working on a narrative that makes their proposed change seem like a good idea to people who don't fully grasp the details of this change. The less people understand their true motives, the easier it is to shut this minority up, either by bribing, by smear campaigns, or other means. If successful, the vast majority will be on their side, and any doubters will easily be labeled as a toxic minority that is trying to harm Bitcoin, spread FUD, or just don't know what they are talking about.\n\nWhat I'm saying with this (way too long) intro is that the more complex the system, the more ways there are to push changes, while making it seem that these changes are benefitial to the system. Because of this, there isn't one definitive way to take the BTC backing away from Bitcoin. If there was, people would see through it and it would never work. Possibly, most of the ways haven't even been thought up yet. I will outline one or two hypothetical scenarions, but because of reasons mentioned, I'm not saying this will be the way.

The outputs have a script that allows a new update transaction to be attached immediately or else a settlement transaction to be attached after a configurable timeout. Should the participants agree on an update before the timeout expires, they will create a new update transaction, spending the previous output and doublespending the corresponding settlement, effectively invalidating it.\n\n&gt;\tNot really no, the bitcoin core assumptions is miner can\u2019t be trusted with the mempool, that\u2019s the whole idea behind RBF.\n\nNo, it\u2019s that perfect mempool sync is impossible, and that occassional race conditions may exist, and that it\u2019s impossible to make a consensus rule around \u201cfirst seen\u201d, because that varies based on your location in the network.  It\u2019s also because the default state of a successful and valuable network is going to be full blocks, and without RBF and with miners rejecting double spends you end up in a position where you have to wait for some unknown amount of time(mempool expiration is also not a consensus rule for obvious reasons) to spend your input(s) if fees happen to increase after you publish your transaction.  Effectively locking those inputs for an indeterminate amount of time.  This leads to unpredictable network behavior from a user perspective.\n\nI\u2019d also like to point out that the current BCH behavior around 0-conf is entirely enforced by miner altruism, and is not based in consensus.  That\u2019s dangerous when relied upon as a guarantee.  It would be like if the current 12.5BTC block reward was not a consensus rule, and that if a miner created a block with a 25BTC coinbase that all other nodes would just accept it instead of rejecting it immediately. No node will reject a block with a transaction confirmed in it that isn\u2019t \u201cfirst seen\u201d as the node understands it.  It will just evict the \u201cfirst seen\u201d transaction from its mempool and keep chugging along.\n\nAlso, RBF is opt-in, so you can accomplish the same thing on BTC by simply not setting the flag on your transaction.\n\n&gt;\tAnd now they make the security of LN relying on them to flag block or choose the proper tx in case flood attack..\n\nCan you elaborate on this?  Flag block?  Choosing the proper transaction?\n\n&gt;\tThis is a 180 degree turn around.\n(Remember 0conf are supposed to be unsecure for that very reason)\n\nI\u2019m not sure that I follow you here.\n\n&gt;\tThis was after the fact.\n\nNo, mine and everyone else\u2019s 2X nodes just stopped at block 494782.

[link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjRoQYsVIY4). Once again, if it does not have a primary use first, it is **not a store of value**. Bitcoin is a horrible store of value.

Everything you see is **speculation**.\n\n&gt; because if mining becomes overly centralized\n\n[link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vM_Ski2eK6A&amp;feature=youtu.be)\n\nAdditionally, centralization is far worse on LN. You have to trust third party watch towers if you can't run a node all the time, which 99.99% of people will be unwilling and unable to do. You won't be able to afford on chain transactions to move your coins to your own wallet. Any small time miners will be unable to afford to move their mining rewards, insuring only the largest of miners mine. And in order to provide liquidity, massive LN hubs will inevitably result. LN will be one of the most centralized payment systems ever devised if implemented how they are trying. But even if somehow all of these problems were overcome...\n\n&gt; We'll deal with those problems then.\n\nThe problems are already here, right **now**. Bitcoin has had a scaling problem for **years**. LN is not even close to being ready. There is not even a route-finding solution that will scale to a million users. Watchtowers have not been figured out. It is completely impractical. LN not only needs to work, it needs to be more **attractive** to the average user than literally any other coin, or even a credit card, and it needs to be 100% safe. [link](https://twitter.com/starkness/status/959856864291905542?lang=en)\n\n&gt; For now, people are confident that their money isn't going to depreciate because of rash decisions\n\n\ud83d\ude02. Even if that were true, they're still not confident in BTC, otherwise you wouldn't see a 60% sell off over the course of a few months. \ud83d\ude02\n\n&gt; to alleviate a short-term problem\n\nThere is no short term problem in increasing the blocksize to 32 mbs. Today's hardware could **easily** handle blocks of several hundred megabytes. Bitcoin's original blocksize was 32 mbs, and that was almost 10 years ago. 1mb is a laughing stock.

As long as you know this, then the means of actually making this happen don't strictly matter. If you can do it cheaply (by not storing it), then I'd consider that superior.\n\nThat doesn't mean LN is the one and only technology to do this. There may be other approaches that are superior and are less complex than LN. But we seem to be missing the wood for the trees. The purpose of the blockchain isn't to store and propagate every transaction - it's to provide a means of proving ownership of capital through public key cryptography without third-parties, whilst removing the ability to forge or double-spend. Storing and propagating every transaction is how this was initially realized - but people seem to be missing the point as to *why* that was done.\n\nIf Bitcoin Cash can come up with a solution to privacy, a solution to unlimited expansion (allowing me to continue to transact without third-parties), then you might convince me to switch, but I'm not seeing it.

Miners have an amount of skin in the game \u221d (proportional) to their fixed cost investment.  \nBusinesses that have integrated Bitcoin have skin in the game, \u221d to their reliance on it.   \nIndividuals that hold bitcoin have skin in the game \u221d to their holdings.\n\n&gt; 6.

It is not fair to compare this against Bitcoin.\n\nMonero can fork frequently because its user-base is almost entirely technical competent individuals who have no trouble securing their machines and updating this software.\n\n&gt; Like when people last June bought $100 worth of bitcoin and were able to move it for a few dollars, then moved it last December when the fees were $50 per transaction and realized it didn't function as they expected to when they acquired it?\n\nShort-term thinking. People in BTC are well aware of the fee problems and we're all looking forward for solutions. The debate is about how to achieve those solutions. The POV of Bitcoiners is that extremely large blocks can only lead to an increase in the centralization of mining and validation of their coins, which is another loss of confidence in that store of value proposition, because if mining becomes overly centralized then miners could collude to inflate the supply.\n\nOn the other hand, there's proposals for payment channels, which don't contribute to mining centralization and don't sacrifice some of Bitcoin's fundamental properties. People look at this more optimistically, and are willing to put up with those higher fees temporarily while we find the right scaling solutions.\n\nIt may be the case that hard forks are needed in BTC, or that we can't find an off-chain scaling solution after trying. We'll deal with those problems then. For now, people are confident that their money isn't going to depreciate because of rash decisions made to alleviate a short-term problem (and creating a potential even bigger problem in the long run).

Accept it, without getting defensive or negative.\n\n- I see people trash TRX constantly, despite the fact that the price 2X'ed in the 2 weeks leading up to testnet and also 2X'ed in 5 weeks leading up to MainNet.  They have their own platform, own partners, and an Ivy-League educated CEO who believes in marketing.  I am not a TRX fan but I'm also not going to call a coin a sh&amp;% coin if it employs 100 programmers from Amazon, Alibaba, Google, and Microsoft.\n\n- Any time a new, or next generation, platform shows up on the scene, holders of other platforms freak out and spew negativity without understanding the tech, business model, or use cases.  There is plenty of room for dozens, if not hundreds of platforms in the future.\n\nGrow up.  You are not saving the world by investing in crypto.  You are not the devs building the tech that represents the future.  You are an investor who hopes for the best so that you can have more $ in your acct than what you started with.  If you want to save the world, donate and volunteer.  If you want to contribute to the tech of the future, learn to program and build your own DApps or apply to these blockchain companies.  Stop pretending that buying a coin on an exchange means you understand the competitive landscape and tech under the hood.  Cheer your fellow brothers and sisters on in the market.  The more projects that succeed, the more credibility the entire market receives.  It's better for all of us if projects succeed rather than failing.  No more hatred.  We are one army.  Crypto. Blockchain.  Technology.  New wave of doing everything in an outdated world.  Let's all win together and stop bashing other projects that we forgot to invest in.  Stop attacking projects that are making their holders more money than your project is making you.  Stop dissing projects that think marketing is a helpful aspect of running a business.  Stop putting down projects that have a similar product as the one you invested in.  The cream will rise to the top, thanks to the actual devs performances and CEOs roadmaps, not bc of the holders reddit posts nor TG messages.  We are fans, sitting in the seats.  We are not on the field, making plays.  Let the teams do the talking with their products, use cases, and partners.  They are the only ones on the field, making plays.

If you're in a concentration camp watching your child about to die from starvation, and you have a briefcase full of cash, how much would you pay for it? Likewise, if  you're stuck underwater, what price is a canister of oxygen worth to you? Value comes from **usefulness and scarcity.** It does not come from scarcity alone. A currency needs to be useful as money. It can not be a store of value alone. That quality is secondary. And before you bring up gold, know that gold is completely different than software. Software is not a rare earth element, can not be used in jewelry or electronics, can not be held in your hand, can easily be forked, etc. etc. Additionally, there are thousands of other cryptocurrencies out there. It is absurd to believe that one would be a store of value, while another, separate coin would be used as a currency. **The coin that does the latter will be the former**. This is basic economics.

Having a buy strategy is easy. Sell strategy can be more challenging. Come up with something a little more sophisticated than HODL...because there has to be an endpoint somewhere\n\nDamn right they move fast. And yeah, have a plan going in to the field and STICK TO IT. Only adjust plans if you are in a level headed state of mind, and any adjustments to your plan have a logical way to approach risk/reward rebalancing in a safe and healthy way.\n\n&gt;2) if you are losing sleep over this you are overly invested.\n\nYup. If your investment makes you worried, you need to rebalance IMMEDIATELY. You've already put yourself in a vulnerable situation. You need to emphasize safety.\n\n&gt;3) unless you are skilled and know what you\u2019re doing, i recommend that you do not day-trade\n\nDay trading is like trying to \"go pro\" in a sport after doing a month of \"pick up\" games at a local park.\n\n&gt;4) do research, read white papers. There\u2019s a lot of convincing propaganda especially here on Reddit. Learn to sift through the bullshit and hold conversations on substance. Seek reliable sources on your information to make thoughtful decisions. Seek to make investments in projects that you think will grow and mature in 3-5 years.\n\nI read a new white paper 3-4 times a week. I basically grab the biggest (in terms of market cap) coin's white paper that I haven't read yet. I'm about 300 white papers in, and this has helped so much!\n\n&gt;5) fomo is emotional, and you do not want to make emotionally charged decisions with your investments.\n\nYup. A level headed person almost always takes an emotional investor's money.\n\n&gt;6) create a thoughtful, balanced and diversified portfolio that is built up overtime. \n\nYup. That allocation needs to reflect your understanding and the risk involved. Anything over 10% of your total investments without robust knowledge of crypto is asking for a problem. Don't even think about investing in crypto without a maxed out Roth IRA.\n\n&gt;7) Consider DCA (dollar cost averaging in) with an investment amount that does not break your finances or quality of life. Invest only what you can and prepare to see everything go to 0. \n\nEvery single person who has done DCA for over a year or more does not regret doing DCA.\n\n&gt;8) Be careful how many times a day you check the price of crypto. If you are making longer term investments the price right now, or 5 mins from now won\u2019t make a difference on what you do... so go live life and get off your phone.\n\nTHIS. So much this. It's fun to watch, but don't let your daily viewing influence your actions.\n\n&gt;9) Engage with a community of people, trade ideas, get active in the movement. Be a catalyst and an activist in the projects you believe in. You don\u2019t have to be a tech person to be part of the movement.\n\nYup! Being a participant gives insight from many areas. Start a small community or Whatsapp/telegram channel with some friends and keep learning as a group.\n\n&gt;10) have fun. This is an amazing time to be alive. Welcome to the club.\n\nEnjoy the ride, this is gonna be a crazy ride.

Hard forks introduce a big problem for potential double spending or theft if everyone is not up-to-date on the news and have updated all of their software to support the new forks.

Because of this, you can always prove how much money is in a given channel by looking at the opening transaction, even if you do not know exactly what the balance between the two individuals in the channel is.  By itself, this alone provides a significant level of protection against coin-inflation through the LN.\n\nIt's also important to understand what an LN transaction is.  An LN transaction represents a BTC transaction between two parties which simply has not been broadcast to the network to be mined.  Broadcasting this transaction to the network would mean that you close out the channel.  Closing the channel amounts to spending the BTC that was tied to the opening transaction.  So it's impossible to close a *channel* with a greater total amount of BTC than it was opened with, though the balances between the two parties may have changed wildly.  This ignores things like \"topping up\" a channel to increase its balances, which more or less boils down to simultaneously closing and reopening a new channel between the same two parties.  When a new transaction occurs, the last \"channel state\" is invalidated by both participants in the channel.  I won't dive into the full details here because there are plenty of resources online for it, and most of them are not directly tied to this discussion.\n\nSo, let's say you have the following \"LN Network\"\n\n* A has a channel with B\n* B has a channel with C\n* C has a channel with D\n\nFor simplicity, let's say each of these channels has 10BTC, meaning 5 BTC on each side.  So the network would look like this:\n\n    A/5-----5/B/5-----5/C/5-----5/D\n\nNow, let's say that A wants to send 1BTC to D.  In a normal, happy network where nobody is trying to cheat or otherwise be dishonest, A sends 1BTC to B, B sends 1 to C, and finally, C sends 1 to D.  The ending state looks like this:\n\n    A/4-----6/B/4-----6/C/4-----6/D\n\nNote how the individual channels still stayed capped at 10 BTC.  Nothing was created or destroyed, just moved around.  Now, if B and C decided to collude to try and cheat the system.  They decide to do this by refusing to update the channel balance between them, so that \"it never runs out\" and they can keep collecting fees.\n\n    A/4-----6/B/5-----5/C/4-----6/D\n\nAgain, we see that this does not create or destroy any BTC.  Each individual channel it still at 10 total BTC and A and D still have their correct balances.  I should note that it's impossible for only half the payment to go through, such as B accepting the payment from A but D never receiving it because C refused to surrender it.  Either the entire multi-hop payment completes or none of it does.\n\nThis all works because the BTC tied up in the AB channel is different from the BTC used to tie up the BC channel, which is different yet again from the CD channel's BTC.  Each channel was secured by its own, publically available and verifiable transaction on the BTC blockchain.  Even if B and C decided that they wanted their channel to \"have 50 BTC\" instead of just 10, they cannot ever get away with it because the entire BTC, and LN, network knows that the channel cannot total beyond 10 BTC - and they cannot give any of this fake BTC away to A or D because those channels are funded with different BTC in a different transaction, and both A and D know what the state of their respective channels are supposed to be.\n\nHopefully this demonstrates some of the robustness of the LN, and why it's just as secure as the blockchain that it is based upon.  It cannot be compromised without also compromising the underlying BTC blockchain.  Lastly, because a channel's balance is verifiable directly on the base layer, even if it's more difficult to determine the actual balance between two parties (privacy!?), you can rest assured that any and all LN transactions are done with real BTC, backed by the real PoW and security of the network, without any funny business.

BTC appears to be focusing first on being a\ncensorship-resistant store of value and improving its scalability over the long term, foremost\nthrough second-layer solutions; BCH is focused on immediate payments competitiveness\nthrough on-chain scaling. At the time of writing, BCH is cheaper for payments than BTC,\nacceptance of BCH for payments appears to be growing, and there are doubts in some\nquarters about both the timing and degree of success of BTC\u2019s second-layer scaling efforts.\nOn the other hand, BCH is seen as weaker as a store of value and to have a weaker\ndevelopment team. BCH would just be another alt-coin as far as BTC is concerned but for\n(a) potential user confusion due to the similarity of the names and the ownership of the\ndomain bitcoin.com by one of BCH\u2019s promoters, who actively claims that BCH is the \u2018true\nBitcoin\u2019; (b) the fact that BCH and BTC share and compete for the same hash power; and (c)\nthe fact that BCH is being promoted by individuals with significant BTC holdings, who run\nlarge exchanges and wallet companies and hold sway over a significant amount (maybe more\nthan 50% collectively) of hash power. Factor (b) raises the concern that, because BTC\u2019s\ndifficulty adjustment is fortnightly while BCH\u2019s is daily, a significant increase in the price of\nBCH relative to BTC would cause hash power to swing away from BTC to BCH, slowing or\nhalting BTC block times until the next BTC difficulty adjustment.33\n Factor (c) means that\nBCH\u2019s main backers may try to attack BTC by various means with a non-zero probability of\nsuccess.\nThis blog post and this blog post go into scenarios in which the price of BCH could increase\nin the short run relative to the price of BTC. In a nutshell, if such price swings are temporary,\nso should be the disruption caused by them, and as a store of value BTC is less sensitive\n(store-of-value use implies generally larger, less time-sensitive transactions) to this kind of\nshort term disruption than BCH is as a means of payment (generally smaller, time-sensitive\n\n33 You can follow the swings in hashrate between BTC and BCH here. \n22\ntransactions). Furthermore, this disruption in block times assumes transaction fees are held\nconstant, but in reality transaction fees can adjust upwards to defend against short term\nattacks to keep hash power allocated to BTC and keep blocks moving, especially again\nbecause BTC functions more as a store of value than as a means of payment and as such is\nless sensitive to fluctuations in transaction fees.\nThe easiest and most prudent way to hedge against this risk is simply to own the same\nnumber of both tokens.\n34 But if forced to get off the fence, the implications of the investment\nthesis laid out in this paper are that we should bet on store-of-value strength over means-ofpayment\nstrength, as we expect the former to be worth more than the latter over time. By\nfocusing on the competitive and commoditised payments space, BCH is fighting for a place\nin a structurally fragmented use case where it doesn\u2019t really seem to do anything new or\nbetter compared to existing payment rail cryptocurrencies such as Dash and Litecoin,\n35 not to\nmention the sovereign digital currencies that will soon appear; BTC is currently out ahead on\nits own as the leading crypto monetary store of value, a use case that is less prone to\nfragmentation and more likely to be dominated by a single cryptoasset. If BTC is the\nstronger store of value, it should remain more valuable than BCH and profit-driven miners\nshould continue to allocate more hash power to it over the long run. Tortoise and hare-style,\nthere\u2019s also a good chance that BTC\u2019s various second-layer development efforts will make it\nmore relevant for payments, smart contracts and the like over time, providing potential\nupsides beyond the core store-of-value case.\n\n- John Pfeffer", "Date": 1528037913}, {"text": "This isn't true at all.

There\u2019s a lot of convincing propaganda especially here on Reddit. Learn to sift through the bullshit and hold conversations on substance. Seek reliable sources on your information to make thoughtful decisions. Seek to make investments in projects that you think will grow and mature in 3-5 years.\n\n5) fomo is emotional, and you do not want to make emotionally charged decisions with your investments.\n\n6) create a thoughtful, balanced and diversified portfolio that is built up overtime. \n\n7) Consider DCA (dollar cost averaging in) with an investment amount that does not break your finances or quality of life. Invest only what you can and prepare to see everything go to 0. \n\n8) Be careful how many times a day you check the price of crypto. If you are making longer term investments the price right now, or 5 mins from now won\u2019t make a difference on what you do... so go live life and get off your phone.\n\n9) Engage with a community of people, trade ideas, get active in the movement.

You want to increase adoption as fast as possible by allowing use cases that require zero fee transactions, but what happens when eventually you have to charge fees? And when will that point be? All these use cases will suddenly not be viable. How exactly is bulking up your numbers going to help achieve real adoption? When you give something away for free and you plan to start charging for it in the future, is this really adoption at all? \n\nAt least you're concerned about the real issue with Bitcoin cash though. Personally the 32mb blocksize is incredibly reckless in my opinion. In just 14 years almost 99% of coins will have been mined and the block reward will be just 0.78125 BCH. Obviously even as a BTC supporter I hope BCH gains adoption but developers are making huge risky assumptions at the risk of security. For example what happens if in 14 years that BCH is only hitting 16MB worth of transactions (all paying a fee). At an average rate of $0.15 per kb that equals just $2400 of fees to miners. Meaning the value of one BCH has to be around $15,000 just to equal the current reward miners get at the moment. You might feel this is perfectly plausible, and maybe it is, it wouldn't surprise me, but its a very long way from a certainty, a VERY long way. Bitcoin has been around for more than ten years and I firmly believe that we wouldn't even fill 2mb blocks if we had them. Sure, during peak bubble times we would, but that's a bad metric to base things on. For developers to make these kind of reckless decisions is very unprofessional when dealing with people's money.

Its so easy to just \"ban\" someone and then they are gone forever...or so you think.  Unfortunately, that is not how reality works.  They can still post you just won't see what they say.  Its a really poor way of dealing with a counter argument.  But..before I joined reddit I had never seen such a broad rejection of counter opinions...people just ban and thats it, often without even thinking about what the person is saying.  Its...a really stupid level of discourse.   You can be on Youtube and get a better level of discussion lol...lots of stupid posts..but people are actually exposed..to all thinking, no matter how stupid...just banning is not using your mind.  Its an issue with Reddit itself as they make it quite easy to create some kind of false \"safe space\"..which I have never seen to such extent on ANY other platform.\n\nWhich is what gets you...such insular thinking and cult\\-like atmosphere's.

Deal with critisicm.   Learn from it.  Reddit helps enable this behavior and allows for over\\-zealous moderation..as there is 0 recourse as mods can pretty much ban and block for whatever they want..as simple not liking what you are saying.   This is a problem as it creates such stupid, insular, and thoughtLESS conversation at that point. \n\nI don't know the solution...except to have people be more open to discussing negative things about their coins, and have moderators not be so quick to take the easy way out and press a button.

That is to say, he didn't come up with an idea for peer\\-to\\-peer e\\-cash that everyone is now trying to 'fill in'; he presented a more or less complete solution to the problems involved in designing such a system, which includes scalability. \n\nAs I see it, the position of the big\\-block bitcoiners in this subreddit is not to deify Satoshi for Satoshi's sake, but rather to do two things: \\(1\\) point to the fact that Bitcoin need not have a \"scaling problem\" if only we follow the actual design; \\(2\\) demonstrate why this design will work, and discuss its relative merits in comparison with other scaling models. \n\nFor some reason the first point also seems to involve the necessity of proving that Satoshi *actually thought* the network should scale by blocksize. Which is absurd, as we can see from Satoshi's *second* email that this was always the assumption:\n\n&gt;Long before the network gets anywhere near as large as that \\[hundreds of millions of people are doing transactions\\], it would be safe  for users to use Simplified Payment Verification \\(section 8\\) to check for double spending, which only requires having the chain of block headers, or about 12KB per day. Only people trying to create new coins would need to run  network nodes. At first, most users would run network nodes, but as the  network grows beyond a certain point, it would be left more and more to  specialists with server farms of specialized hardware.

Are you able to help me figure out what that is?  Then you and I can both reach a concrete way for us to get closer to the truth :)\n\n&gt; Development is great, no issue with it. But betting your present and near-future success on an unproven, yet-to-be-made technology rather than doing what Bitcoin has been doing successfully for years prior - increasing block size - is incompetent.\n\nI think you are misunderstanding our reasoning.  It does *not* go:\n\n- [A] This lightning network thing looks like it will solve our scaling problems.\n\n- [B] We can afford to restrict blocksize because [A].\n\nIn fact, our reasoning goes like this:\n\n- (1) Blocksize increases threaten the censorship resistant nature of Bitcoin.\n\n- (2) We need to look for other methods to scale because (1).\n\n- (3) This Lightning thing looks like it could help a lot with (2).  Let's pursue it (and other things) and see how far it gets us.\n\nNow, I'm aware you probably don't agree with (1), and that's OK.  You have the opportunity to prove us wrong with BCH.\n\nBut several arguments you've used here seem to indicate you think we are using the [A][B] reasoning, when in fact we are using the (1)(2)(3) reasoning, so I think that's worth clarifying.  Does that communicate my position more clearly?\n\n&gt; Not increasing the block size when **Lightning itself requires it** is simply malicious.\n\nI'm not ready to fully agree with the bolded claim.\n\nFrom what I've seen, blocksize increases required for Lightning tend to be based on how channels must be opened/closed from the original paper, but a lot has changed since then.  Are you aware of the paper from last year about [channel factories](https://www.tik.ee.ethz.ch/file/a20a865ce40d40c8f942cf206a7cba96/Scalable_Funding_Of_Blockchain_Micropayment_Networks%20(1\\).pdf)?  That's one example of a way to fit a lot more channels into a single transaction than we thought possible.  Combined with signature aggregation, that changes a lot of earlier assumptions about the blockspace needed.\n\nNow, you may turn out to be right - it is possible that we will need larger blocks in the future.

There are many \npeople, especially those who support a UASF or PoW change that believe a distributed system should \nbe completed as a mesh. In this, they confuse centralised systems with centrality. The truth of the matter, \nno matter which proof of work system is implemented, they all follow a maximal growth curve that \nreflects the nature of the firm as detailed in 1937 by Ronald Coase (1937).  \n\n&gt; The bitcoin White Paper was very specific. users of the system \"vote with their CPU power\" [1]. What \nthis means, is that the system was never generated to give one vote per person. It is designed purely \naround economic incentives individuals with more hash power will have provided more investment into \nthe system. These individuals who invest more in the system gain more say in the system. At the same \ntime, no one or even two individuals can gain complete control of the system. We'll explore the nature \nof cartels in a separately, but these always fail without government intervention. The reason for cartels \nfailing comes down to the simple incentivisation of the most efficient member. The strongest cartel \nmember always ends up propping up the weakest. This leads to a strategy of defection. \n\n&gt; No proof of work-based solution ever allows for a scenario where you have one vote to one person. The \nanti-sybiling  functions  of bitcoin  and all  other  related  systems  based  on  proof  of  work or  similar \nderivatives are derived from an investment based strategy. Solutions to the implementation of ASIC \nbased systems are constantly proposed as a methodology of limiting the centralisation of proof of work \nsystems as it is termed. The truth of the matter is that the mining function within any proof of work \nsystem naturally aligns to business interests. This leads to corporations running machines within data \ncentres. On the way that democracies and republics have migrated away from small groups of people \nindividually voting for an outcome towards a vote for a party, the transactional costs associated with \nindividual choice naturally leads to corporate solutions. In this, the corporation mirrors a political party. \n\n&gt; In this paper, we address the issues of using alternate approval work systems with regards to either \nincorporating alternate functions in an extension of simply securing the network against the use of proof \nof work systems to create a one person one vote scenario in place of economic incentivisation. We will \ndemonstrate conclusively that all systems migrate to a state of economic efficiency. The consequence \nof this is that systems form into groups designed to maximise returns. The effect is that bitcoin is not \nonly incentive compatible but is optimal. No system can efficiently collapse into an order of one vote \none individual and remain secure. In the firm-based nature of bitcoin, we demonstrate that the inherent \nnature of the firm is reflected within mining pools. Multiple aggregation strategies exist. The strategies \nrange from the creation of collective firms where members can easily join or leave (mining pools) \nthrough to more standard corporate structures.  \n\nMining won't be completely centralized but it will be corporatized with competing factions competing in a form of a Stackelberg game.  There will be market leaders and followers who at times are overthrown.  This is how the economic incentivization of Bitcoin works.  Jameson Lopp also has [an interesting article about the future of mining](https://medium.com/@lopp/the-future-of-bitcoin-mining-ac9c3dc39c60), in which he also notes how ASIC proliferation and innovation causes centralized entitites and market leaders to emerge and eventually they are overthrown as technology advances.  This is seen with Ghash.io for example who had 51% at one time [and Peter Todd got scared and sold half his bitcoins](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/281ftd/why_i_just_sold_50_of_my_bitcoins_ghashio/), but now ghash.io is nothing significant.

They are an extremely valuable part of the \\*incentive\\* for miners to keep to the rules.  \n\n\nLet's say 60&amp;#37; of miners decide to change the rules. Let's say they're not after full destruction \\- we'd be in a totally different ball game if that were so. They just want to change the rules to be more of an advantage to them. Let's say they double the block size, to give room for more tranactions. This is more or less like the Segwit2X scenario.\n\nNow, a miner is a business. He has costs. He sells the coins \\(block reward, fee\\) he get to be able to pay that cost.  \n\n\nIf there were two competing chains, things get interesting. So let's say I run an exchange \\- or sell coffee, it's the same, we're all part of the same economy. A miner sends a block that is too large to me. What will my node do? It'll reject the block. To \\*me\\*, it's worthless. Now, what's the value of the BTC in the block? It's what people are willing to give for it! What if miners change the rules, and \\*no\\* exchanges follow through? They'll not be able to sell their coins. All they can do is stash it on the blockcchain. It'd technically be valid, but if noone buys it, then it's worthless.  \n\n\nWell, we still have 40&amp;#37; honest miners. Blocks will be slow for a while, that's for sure. But they're there, they can recoup their money. Fees will probably be sky\\-high, so it'll be lucrative to stay honest.  \n\n\nSo, what's a non\\-mining full node in this? It's a very useful tool! Without it, you trust someone else to do this choice for you! They might chose the 60&amp;#37; worthless coins, and if you were running a small business, you'd not want to sell your stuff for worthless coins?  \n\n\nNow, of course \\- if you are tricked in to taking the coins for goods, they aren't worthless.

In both cases non-mining nodes have no say. But let's say miners decide to take into account the opinion of node operators. How do they do that? Let's say I'm the attacker. I'll reorg the chain and spin up a few thousand full nodes beforehand. There's just one real node behind all of them, but they have different IPs across the whole world so are indistinguishable from real nodes from the outlook. This is relatively cheap to do. Now I will use thousands of fake social media accounts complete with [NoCensoring] tags by their names, that cry that doing this would compromise chains integrity. There seem to be more nodes agreeing to protect the attacker. How do the honest miners know which to follow? They don't. Unless they only listen to certain \"trusted\" nodes, which beats the point.
