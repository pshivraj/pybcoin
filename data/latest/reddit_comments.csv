2018-06-03,Possible spam by LN developers to ruin our Bitcoin 
2018-06-03,"&gt; If BTC had been a place where innovation was possible, it would have maintained its market dominance.

speculation. would you claim the same about yahoo or microsoft during the dotcom bubble? why were there millions of shit.com projects if yahoo and microsoft were all about innovation?

alternative sprawl is inevitable until reality kicks in and people realize that 99% of those alternatives are shit scams.

&gt; The BTC team capped blocksize

Satoshi capped blocksize. Bitcoin Core team (and majority of bitcoin network of miners, users, merchants and vendors) resisted contentious hardfork proving that expanding the blocksize is not the best strategy to scale on chain capacity.

&gt; I'm not sure how you think it does

of course everything depends on your definition of efficient use of blockchain. segwit enables more transactions to be fit in single block by separating the witness data out of it. keeping witness data part of transaction data structure is inefficient because you could with the same effect only have a reference to witness data instead.

this helps capacity, this helps UTXO size, it is more efficient use of block space.

&gt; something like Nano is better

snake oil

&gt; it's easier to move to altcoins than to use LN

sure, go for it. i feel very much safer having a secure and stable ground under my transaction platform so i'll stick to LN.

&gt; When a transaction is submitted and a fee is paid, the miners are being paid to store that information. Anything that pays the price is valid.

yes, that applies to BTC too. it stops working when your project's jesus decides that price must never be more than a penny.

&gt; What is your priority for a cryptocurrency?

decentralization, don't trust - verify, censorship resistance, network stability. all of these imply we can't let cost of running full node grow out of reach for commodity hardware.

""third world countries"" is a strawman argument. for any meaningful transaction fee there will be somebody in the world for whom it is unacceptable, so the only possible acceptable fee is zero. don't like to use argument from authority fallacy, but since you're so much into satoshi's true vision - they recognized in a whitepaper that fee-less system is unsustainable. if you're fine replacing fees with inflation, giving miners the precedent to contemplate increasing inflation in future (because poor us, there are no fees but so many transactions, we need more moneys) - good luck with that.

&gt; We have had ""free cheese"" for the past 6 or 7 years before the blocksize limit was held at 1mb. Lets remember that 1mb was an arbitrary number decided years ago when computers were much less powerful. We can now easily run 32mb blocks on a home computer.

we probably can. but we have not yet explored all possible ways to increase on chain scaling without resorting to blocksize limit increasing hardfork. for some people being smart about how blockspace is used is much more important than having more blockspace. i'm one of them. there are many of us. because of us such hardfork will always be contentious."

I would say you should know the output or you risk spamming your peers with invalid (i.e. computes to False) transactions.

&gt; Unknown conditional outcomes using Bitcoin script are possible and that also has a utility. It depends on the use case.

What use case benefits from sending transactions which you don't already know compute to True? It's a good way to get your peers to disconnect you. What else would that accomplish? You can't even confidently detect when a transaction has computed to false as invalid transactions are neither relayed nor included in blocks.

&gt;Thats just your idea.

No, it is a consequence of Bitcoin's limited computational abilities. That limitation is not a shortcoming, it is an intentional design decision. You could change BCH to enable Turing-complete computation, but that would be something new.

&gt; Script is very limited in what it can compute, no matter how many transactions you split it across.

2018-06-03,"During previous transaction backlogs people have tended to claim that it’s all just a spam attack from people trying to undermine Bitcoin. In this case that is probably correct.

If you look in detail at the ‘set of plots OP keeps linking](https://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue) you can see that the current 40MB backlog only consists of about 4,000 transactions. Ordinarily a 1MB block can clear between 1,000-2,000 transactions. So what’s filling the mempool right now is a few thousand weirdly large transactions.

You can also see that about 80% of the transactions are currently paying 1 Satoshi per byte, so someone has submitted thousands of weirdly large transactions with the smallest possible fee.

Now, anyone who wants to send a normal transaction needs to outbid this wall of 1-Satoshi data, and a lot of wallets are notoriously bad at overestimating the fees necessary. So if the backlog doesn’t clear it’s likely we will see high fees on BTC pretty soon."

2018-06-03,"&gt; Right, but you won't know that's happening unless you're running a node (I'm assuming we agree that we need to avoid trusting others).

You are not required to trust anyone, you of course trust the incentives mechanism of bitcoin otherwise you wouldn't have any coins or use it in the first place.

&gt; But doing that means sacrificing trustlessness.

More or less, I'd say no if there are enough enough competing explorers around. Ultimately, you can just listen to blocks yourself.

The only reason to have the full blockchain is if you want to control very old UTXOs. Say someone wants to spend an UTXO from 2013 for 100x the actual amount. Everyone (other) competing miner has a big incentive to reject that in a block because this will make the block invalid and they will publish their block instead.

No miner has incentive to mine it because they will waste money.

Again, your trust is a trust in a system of incentives.

It is true that Jihan or bitmain could physically, practically, try to cheat like that, but it would be blatant and they would be screwed.

2018-06-03,"&gt; Blocks can only ""scale"" by raising the block size. Forget about bandwidth, storage, processing power, etc. There is a fundamental limit to transaction throughput on a blockchain network. I'm not just talking about bitcoin!

So you are really going to try and shift a scaling debate away from its fundamental constraints, which are exactly what you just told me to ""forget"".  bandwidth, storage, processing power, are the exact things which are needed to scale the blocksize limit. Do you understand this? Because it seems like you dont.

IOTA traded its security for chaintips, Do you understand this?

&gt; And this is what the rest of the world is talking about when we talk about scaling. LN does not have this fundamental limit. It has some technical issues like bandwidth, uptime, and time constraints that can affect real-world throughput. I get that. 
 
No the fundamental limit is the bandwidth, and uptime and routing algorithms which are NP hard.

&gt; This could only happen if you agreed to do that. You do realize every LN transaction would be valid as an on-chain transaction, right? Because of this, you have to sign each LN transaction with your key. In order to be paid out in shitokens, you would have to sign a transaction that pays out in shitokens.

I'm not just talking about bitcoin! Every chain, including altcoins (except some exotic ones like IOTA) will have this problem. This is not necessarily bad; It is just how the system is designed. But it is a problem if you want more than a few dozen tx/s on the network, which we will eventually. 

Do you understand this? Because it seems like you don't. 

And this is what the rest of the world is talking about when we talk about scaling. LN does not have this fundamental limit. It has some technical issues like bandwidth, uptime, and time constraints that can affect real-world throughput. I get that. But these are engineering problems, not scaling problems. 

&gt; You are plainly ignoring the complexity of routing, which is made even worse via LN.

First of all, bitcoin doesn't have transaction-level routing, it doesn't need it. So routing isn't ""made even worse"" by LN, it is a LN only problem. Second, more importantly, I am not ""ignoring"" the complexity of routing. It is very complex and note-worthy. I was just talking about scaling, and scaling is not affected by routing. Routing isn't even part of the LN protocol. But we do have routing solutions, they just aren't optimal. Someone could come up with a perfectly optimal solution tomorrow and boom, routing solved, and nothing would need to be changed in LN. And there doesn't need to be a single routing solution! We could have many routing solutions, custom tailored to the transaction type. And my guess is that is how it will end up getting solved. But all of that doesn't matter because fundamentally, there is no transaction limit in LN. Do you understand this?

&gt; As a holder of BTC yourself you will end up keeping your digital gold but it would be settled on the other end in a shitoken.  

This could only happen if you agreed to do that. You do realize every LN transaction would be valid as an on-chain transaction, right? Because of this, you have to sign each LN transaction with your key. In order to be paid out in shitokens, you would have to sign a transaction that pays out in shitokens. You can take off the tinfoil hat, you are talking about an impossible scenario.

2018-06-03,"&gt; Bitcoin is a system that aims to solve the double spending problem. This problem is solved if, and only if one can determine a timeline of transactions that logically precede others. This is what miners do, this is not what core-QT wallets (""full nodes"") will ever do.

&gt; So, if you get double spent, your core-QT wallet can see it but it won't be able to do anything at all about it. Nothing, nada.

Yes, this is why you must wait for confirmations before being able to confirm that you've actually received funds.

&gt; In this sense, the validity of transactions is absolutely independent of anything NOT being done by the validators, aka miners, the ones making sure that no one is getting away with cheating.

&gt; Why? Because miners will get anything they can that is invalid in a competing block to invalidate that block and push their own block instead.

And if some miners decides to include extra transactions minting themselves extra coins, causing a split?

How would you know which chain to follow?  How do you know you're not stuck on a chain where illegitimate inflation has occurred?

&gt; Another totally unrelated and different issue is: do users matter? Yes, of course they matter, if there are no users, there is no bitcoin, the coins would be worthless. But users do not decide what is valid or not, they decide what has value or not by using and purchasing coins. For that they don't need anything remotely similar to ""full nodes"". Not even miners can pull out a magic and make the coins worth something, so they are always worried that the network runs smooth.

But without full nodes, the users don't have a way to know that they're operating on a valid chain."
2018-06-03,"Yeah I got that from the condescending tone of your previous reply. But as I said in my last post, I've already addressed your criticisms, but you have not seen that and now claim that I haven't done so.  If I claim I have done so and reiterate my previous points, we'll only go back in a circle.

But since you insist, I'll give it one last go.

The level of immutability of a blockchain is part technological construct and part social contract.  The social contract is the underlying foundation.  By removing that and forking, Ethereum negated the technological construct as well, since the community proved it can just move to a new technological construct.  This means that no technological construct can be relied upon, and thus any security that arises from such a construct is likewise completely unreliable.  A Bitcoin transaction, or an Ethereum Classic transaction for that matter, is protected by its mining hash power and how much proof of work has been built on top of it.  An Ethereum transaction has no such security model, since there is precedent of just forking to negate a transaction that was unpopular, and the proof of work built on top of it is irrelevant in such a scenario.  Thus the security provided by the proof of work is not actually present."

Bitcoin Script can perform limited bounded computation without any additional mechanisms. A Turing-complete system which uses the blockchain transactions as its tape _would be_ a universal computer. But Bitcoin would only be _a part_ of that computer - no more Turing-complete itself than a spool of ticker tape.

There is nothing particularly special about the tape of a Turing-machine, except its infinite length in the abstract implementation.

Why? Because miners will get anything they can that is invalid in a competing block to invalidate that block and push their own block instead.

It is not that difficult to understand that your ''trust in miners'' is a trust in a *system of incentives* (not the people mining) where each of them are competing to make more money than the other one. This is essentially bitcoin: **a system of economical incentives to keep a timeline of transactions that once validated get exponentially difficult, and financially prohibitive, to be reversed**.

To further show you that a mesh of core-QT wallets (what people call nodes erroneously) is a TERRIBLE idea for consensus, it is very cheap to spin nodes behind ever changing IPs to make a sybil attack. The ""one IP one vote"" problem is mentioned in the whitepaper and it IS an inherent problem for any consensus mechanism.

You simply CAN'T trust that ''two entities'' in the network are not the same entity.

Imagine deciding elections based on reddit votes. The candidate behind more phony accounts will always win. Now, imagine deciding if your money was properly sent to someone based on reddit votes. Same problem, but now scammers have a far greater incentive to make as much as fake identities possible, they want to steal your money.

This is what core wants you to believe, that you contribute somehow to the security and/or validity of the network running Core-QT wallets (""full nodes""). I can set up an unlimited amount of different Core-QT wallets running everywhere in the world.

Another totally unrelated and different issue is: do users matter? Yes, of course they matter, if there are no users, there is no bitcoin, the coins would be worthless.

2018-06-03,"You basically have to bid to get your transaction into a block. If there's 10 spots for transactions in a block, and there's 15 transactions pending, a miner typically will pick the 10 transactions with the highest bid. The 5 transactions that are left over will wait until the next block and the bidding process happens again.

If there's 10 transactions but the block has capacity for 20 transactions, then your bid can be a small as possible because you have no competition.

Btw this bidding thing is not a rule of bitcoin. Miners can include whatever transactions they want, even no transactions. This behavior arises naturally because that's the greedy thing to do. As a miner, you'll include the transactions that have a higher bid, because you pocket the bids and you'll make more money this way.

Right now on BTC, there's more transactions pending than there is capacity in one block right now. That means there's more competition to get in a block, so you have to outbid other people by putting a higher fee. The higher fee is still super tiny though, so whatever."

2018-06-03,"&gt; When talking about scaling, I don't mean any given person can spend infinite money. I mean that there could be theoretically infinite transactions per second (tx/s) ON THE NETWORK etc.

Again, these are not really transactions until they close. And no its not theoretically infinite, it would be constrained by bandwidth speed and is limited to the range of the channel. Blocks have a real potential to scale, given moore's law, and also the fact that hardware has been held back for years already. Bandwidth constraints are also very much last mile issues and ISP's throttle speeds down.

&gt; This is false. There is no theoretical limit to the number of routing hops in LN. Plus, market forces (aka fees) will encourage any given user will purposely keep routing hops to a minimum anyway.

Not false, true. As in happened in the real world and not some theoretical bullshit. You are plainly ignoring the complexity of routing, which is made even worse via LN.

&gt; I have no idea what you are talking about here. If transactions are checks, HTLC is roughly equivalent to post-dating. How do you recognize a post-dated check in a different token? That's like saying ""If you post-date a check, the bank could give you Chuck-E-Cheese tokens instead"". No they can't, and if they could, they could do that to any check.

Channels have outer and inner HTLC's, which are very similar to atomic swaps. If an HTLC is recognized in another token (LTC, DOGE), it can be used as an inner HTLC to fund channels between you and another party. As a holder of BTC yourself you will end up keeping your digital gold but it would be settled on the other end in a shitoken. LN hubs can aggregate the gold, and throw shitokens at the good money.

Plus CBA is one of the least crypto friendly banks, froze users accounts when they were trying to use their own money to buy from exchanges, won't process credit card payments all while testing blockchain technology in the background. "
2018-06-03,"&gt;This is exactly the same as coming up with a brand-new protocol. It is impossible for this new protocol to affect the already existing channels without those channel owners actively closing out their channels and choosing to use the new one. The key here is choice. It cannot be forced onto anyone just like a change to the consensus rules cannot be forced onto anyone. Remember that all of this is open source, peer-reviewed code. Nobody will accept a closed-source transaction format in the same way that nobody will accept a closed-source wallet. You simply can't make a change like the one you're describing without the entire world noticing and opting out of whatever ""FED-ning"" Network you're trying to create.

But why will all the people accustomed to using LN have a choice if, in fact, the LN hubs are centralized enough that governments can shut them down if they don't comply? If the actual blockchain has remained capped, it will not be able to handle the transaction volume of a large number of LN users suddenly deciding they don't want to use LN anymore. But all the LN hubs people are used to using can say ""we're shutting down your old channels and refunding your BTC, but you can get right back on to LN as you know it by funding a new channel (let's call it a ""Lightning 2.0"" channel) with us. Given the choice of using the now super-congested BTC network they aren't accustomed to using regularly and simply ""upgrading"" to ""Lightning 2.0"" channels, what will most users do?

I agree with you that *if* Lightning could *independently* maintain an equal or similar level of decentralization and security as the base chain, then it would be as secure from this kind of tampering and coercion as the base chain. But I have seen [pretty convincing arguments](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGrUOLsC9cw&amp;t=1s) that this is impossible. Moreover, if it were possible, what would even be the point of the base layer? The whole argument, as I understand it, is that the base layer provides security and decentralization, while the 2nd layer provides scale. If the 2nd layer by itself were as secure and decentralized as the 1st and can also scale, what even is the point of the 1st?

I'm skeptical that small blocks with lots of user nodes will ultimately be more decentralized and censorship resistant than big blocks with lots of miner power all over the world, but for the sake of argument, let's say that, in terms of decentralization and censorship resistance BTC&gt;BCH&gt;LN *by itself* (if you actually think LN will be inherently more decentralized and censorship resistant *on its own* than bitcoin with big blocks, then I could agree it would probably be a better way to scale, but that's a whole different conversation related to the above link).

In this case (BTC&gt;BCH&gt;LN at scale) BCH is still a less risky way to scale than BTC+LN, because I don't think it makes sense to say that ""LN relies on BTC for its security and decentralization; therefore, it's as secure as BTC itself."" My whole point is that that's how it is designed to be *now*, but that design is more vulnerable to being tampered with or rewritten than the BCH main chain. It won't matter that, under the old design, LN channel credits were as good as BTC if the government has the power to force the main channel providers to kick users off those old channels, but with the option to start using their new, ""Lightning 2.0,"" (and, again, what choice will they have? Everybody just go back to using the now super-expensive and slow main chain that can't handle anything close to the volume people have grown to expect is possible with LN?)."

2018-06-03,"&gt; but then why do BCH fees fluctuate now?

The transactions do not have that information so it's hard to know. There are probably several factors including wallets that have higher minimums than they should, wallets that calculate badly what the minimum fees are (for example using the average fees), users who choose to pay more fees than they need.

&gt;  And why are the fees for BCH even close (and sometimes higher) than BTC fees?

No? 

&gt; In the white paper Satoshi is discussing nodes on the function level and is talking about miners.

This is true, but irrelevant. Satoshi definitely did have both miners and nodes bundled as one piece of software. We broke those up pretty much as soon as graphics cards started mining. So...pretty early on. The sense in which Satoshi referred to them together is not really relevant to this discussion. The whitepaper was meant to broadcast a general idea, not discuss every nuance. 

&gt;  I call these halfnodes

Ok, but the rest of the world calls them ""Full nodes"", to differentiate from SPV nodes or pruning nodes. 

&gt; They gave almost no real use for the average user. 

Bullshit. They give very real uses to very real users. Every exchange runs a ""halfnode"", and every transaction processor like bitpay, etc. They need to be right on network checking every transaction as it comes in. I run a non-mining fullnode too, so that I can run analytics on the network and have a trusted fully-proven copy of the network. 

&gt; but only a small number of people it groups would be needed to do that at any given time.

The fees will remain low as long as the blocks aren't full. Right now you would need BCH to have over 32x as many transactions (by blocksize, not by raw amount) as BTC for the minimum fee for next block to rise.

BCH can do about 100 to 200 transactions per second without the minimum fee for next block rising above 1 sat./byte."

The fact that later the software allows you to split mining from relaying/verifying doesn't changes this. Functional Bitcoin nodes still do both.

What it does allow us for people to run a ""node"" that doesn't mine. I call these halfnodes, as they're not functional Bitcoin nodes. They gave almost no real use for the average user. At best they give ibservers an easy tool to use to oversee the network, but only a small number of people it groups would be needed to do that at any given time."

Thank you for taking the time to respond. I had two requests, please:

1. Long story really short, I work in wallet development for one of the top wallets, and I've noticed many times in the past that the added network fee for your Bitcoin invoices does not match what the current network conditions are. (e.g. they're way too high). I've submitted this to Github with data/statistics, and I hope that your team has looked into it (this was 2 weeks ago, I haven't shopped since then - have been busy)

2. Many times even when the fee I attach to my transaction is perfectly adequate for a fast transaction ( &lt;60 mins), I receive the email from Bitpay of ""your added fee was too low"", followed with an explanation of how fees work (I'm sure you know which email I'm speaking of). It seems that the times when this email is sent needs to be tweaked."

2018-06-03,"&gt; you are limited by your channel amount, so volume is only a negotiation of the balance,

When talking about scaling, I don't mean any given person can spend infinite money. I mean that there could be theoretically infinite transactions per second (tx/s) ON THE NETWORK. This is as opposed to blockchains, which have an intrinsic limit to the number of transactions ON THE NETWORK. For BTC, this limit is 7 tx/s to 27ish tx/s, depending on segwit usage and for BCH it is 56 tx/s. This number comes from real-world average transaction size, the size of blocks, and the average block time (10 minutes). 

&gt; it does NOT scale in terms of routing hops

This is false. There is no theoretical limit to the number of routing hops in LN. Plus, market forces (aka fees) will encourage any given user will purposely keep routing hops to a minimum anyway. 

&gt; Simple, buy some bitcoins with inflatable shitokens. Make the masses bagholders of the shitokens.

Like, an exchange? But with colored coins? I don't know what you mean. If people want to exchange colored coins for bitcoins, so what? 

&gt;  Recognize HTLC's denominated in shitokens.

I have no idea what you are talking about here. If transactions are checks, HTLC is roughly equivalent to post-dating. How do you recognize a post-dated check in a different token? That's like saying ""If you post-date a check, the bank could give you Chuck-E-Cheese tokens instead"". No they can't, and if they could, they could do that to any check.

2018-06-03,"&gt; That's data, not honest or dishonest. Avg fees are higher for BCH.

It is not the same to say that the fees are higher in BCH than to say that the average of the fees are higher.

&gt; if BCH is going to scale and overtake BTC in transactions, fees need to be lower than BTC (next block or not).

At this moment the fees that users need to pay are lower in BCH than in BTC.

&gt;  I think those fees are going to be pretty bad, maybe crazy bad? Or am I wrong?

2018-06-03,"1 sat/byte is indeed too much. Not only do I think we need to hardcode a successive lowering of this limitation in the nodes (minimum 1 sat/byte this year, 0.8 sat/byte next year, 0.7 after that etc) but I also think we should hardcode nodes to refuse blocks that haven't included at least 40% of the transactions in the node's mempool with a minimum fee. Because otherwise we get this bad ""fee market"" that BTC is stuck with. On BTC many places still send 100 sat/byte transactions even though the blocks aren't full, because they want to be sure miners don't just ignore the transaction. I don't want to repeat this situation again for BCH.

It's just too large risk for big miners to push up the fees even though there's no need what so ever, if the blocks aren't full the fees should NEVER be higher than absolute minimum to prevent spam transactions. The block rewards are miner payment, not the fees. In the future when even 1 satoshi is worth a lot, sure, but not now.

*Btw, the fees in a transaction are just total inputs minus total outputs. 1 sat/byte is just the common way of displaying it. So it's completely possible to make transactions at 0.0001 sat/byte even today, the problem is just that by default nodes are hardcoded to not relay the transaction to the rest of the network if it's not 1 sat/byte.*"

What is BCH volume compared to BTC on an average day...maybe about 10% of BTC volume?

2018-06-03,"Bitcoin BTC and Bitcoin Cash are two versions of the same Bitcoin protocol. Coins like Litecoin, Doge, Dash, et al are not the same Bitcoin protocol, but rather the Bitcoin protocol + customizations."
2018-06-03,"Well, let me see if I can try one more time.   To answer the one question I do know how to answer, you surround something in * for italics and ** for bold.  There is a formatting help link next to the submit post button that gives you a lot of useful reddit-post tips - it's usually available on the sidebar of most mobile apps too.

Now, for the tougher question.  Because LN transactions are a form of smart contract on the BTC blockchain, they're subject to all the consensus rules of that blockchain, plus a few additional rules defined by the BOLT protocol.  Because of this, LN (like segwit) is completely optional for the end user.  If you didn't believe in these solutions, but still wanted to use the BTC blockchain, you can still do so using different transaction formats (such as the traditional P2PKH, or the myriad P2SH formats, such as multisig or even something of your own design).  There are already discussions about how to enable any BTC address to send and receive directly from an LN address without needing to open an LN channel first.  This is very important because it means you do not get excluded from the network if 99.999% of the world adopts LN but you do not or can not do so.  Now, to be clear, I don't think any of this last part has made it out of the discussion/design phase, but it's important to remember that LN is still very much beta software, so I don't expect it to be anywhere near feature-complete in its current form.

Let me see if I can address some of your points directly:

&gt; That explains why it may be impossible to directly steal BTC value of EXISTING LN channels or add more funds than one has to EXISTING LN channels. But what stops someone with enough power and influence over hub operators and devs from creating a new kind of contract, also built on the BTC chain (at least initially), but not redeemable in the same way, or redeemable only under certain, restrictive conditions?

This is exactly the same as coming up with a brand-new protocol.  It is impossible for this new protocol to affect the already existing channels without those channel owners actively closing out their channels and *choosing* to use the new one.  The key here is choice.  It cannot be forced onto anyone just like a change to the consensus rules cannot be forced onto anyone.  Remember that all of this is open source, peer-reviewed code.  Nobody will accept a closed-source transaction format in the same way that nobody will accept a closed-source wallet.  You simply can't make a change like the one you're describing without the entire world noticing and opting out of whatever ""FED-ning"" Network you're trying to create.

&gt; Suppose LN hubs have centralized to a not extreme but not insignificant degree in the US at some point in the future. Let's say the majority of LN transactions go through one of 1000 hubs, most of which are connected to major, well-known companies (that is, the government can fine them, take them to court, etc.).

I would argue this is the same thing as the centralization of fully-validating nodes in BTC or BCH.  In fact, you should also be worried that the ""fewer and fewer"" nodes envisioned by Satoshi and embraced by BCH would share a similar concern.  What happens if a government coerces node owners to change the consensus rules?  Well, that's easy.  Bitcoin (BTC or BCH) is borderless, as well as a million other things; but let's focus on just that one for a moment.  Borderless means that it does not answer to any one jurisdiction, so even if the US Gov could coerce all US-based Nodes to comply with its demands they cannot affect any nodes hosted in any other territories.  The exact same thing is true for any LN node.

For fun, let's examine the worst-case Hub-and-Spoke scenario: All payments are routed through exactly 1 master hub.  This might look something like the following:

             C
             |
    A ----- HUB ----- B
             |
             D

In the above network, any payment from one individual to another individual *must* go through the central hub.  So, let's imagine that Big Brother manages to seize control of the HUB and shuts it down.  What happens?  Well, for one each of the users will basically be forced to close out the channel that they had with the HUB to unlock their BTC.  The HTLC (Hashed Time-Lock Contract) smart contracts that LN is based on are trustless, so, in essence, they're designed specifically to protect users in this type of situation (an adversarial channel partner).  Each user broadcasts to the network the final state of their respective channels to the network and after the previously agreed upon timeframe, their BTC is back in their pocket completely unharmed.  This is very important to understand.  Even in the worst-case scenario, users with a connection to a compromised node are simply inconvenienced, they never lose their BTC (in fact, they may gain some BTC if their channel partner tries to cheat and lie about the balances in the channel).  Additionally, no new BTC can be created or destroyed because even in this doomsday scenario, the closing of a channel is just a regular old BTC transaction, validated by every node on the network.  These users, along with all of the other users in the world, are then free to open new LN channels with each other and the system resumes functioning.  Or, they can abandon the LN and stick with pure on-chain transactions or even some other L2 solution that has not been invented yet.

&gt; The mission: change the fundamental design of LN or create a new ""LN"" functionality that makes it possible for the federal government to open ""LN channels"" (of a sort previously impossible to create) for more ""BTC credit"" than it actually holds BTC at any one time. The design will be such that, initially at least, anyone transacting with the government can still close these ""channels"" (which will actually differ in nature from the original LN channels by allowing one channel to ""cover"" another, but the general public will not understand this distinction) and withdraw the appropriate number of BTC at any time. If necessary, users will be required by the major node operators to close out their ""old,"" 100% BTC-backed LN channels and ""upgrade"" to the new type of channel, since the old channels are ""incompatible"" with the new, government-sanctioned channels.

I believe the above commentary has shown why a mission such as this is impossible.  LN transactions **are** BTC transactions, so they cannot do anything which violates the BTC consensus rules.  Using the LN is optional, so even if you did find a way to shut it down, everyone who was using it can just go back to plain old base-layer transactions, and none of their BTC is ever lost or otherwise compromised.  A government cannot change the rules of the LN for the same reasons that a government cannot change the fundamental consensus rules of any crypto currency."

That's not to say that the now-minority honest chain would be secure.

This is drastic, I think we can scale more slowly and maintain a balance of usability and health of the network (in terms of decentralization). However regardless we can have blocks large enough so that the whole world can use them. Not to mention BCH can scale with big blocks *and* lightning, meanwhile BTC is just using lightning and seems adverse to even minor blocksize increase. Not to mention segwit makes it more difficult to increase the blocksize. 

I don't agree. I think increasing the blocksize is a solution to the scalability problem. "

&gt; Bitcoin Unlimited's findings are already public, and since they used Bitcoin Core as their choice implementation, anyone can go and verify their findings with minimum effort.

What prevents Bitcoin Unlimited from just launching a public testnet?

There were many things, which had academic papers published decades ago, but still have not resulted in anything of practical value. Some examples are [cold fusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_fusion) or [EmDrive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RF_resonant_cavity_thruster).

&gt; Thanks for that link for the LN stores. If I ever have a reason to obtain BTC, move them into a SegWit address, lock them up in a payment channel, and spend them at stores that don't sell anything I want and likely don't ship to me, that will really come in handy.

You can [try Eclair Wallet on a Bitcoin testnet](https://steemit.com/cryptocurrency/@chronicusprime/how-to-try-out-lightning-network-using-eclair-app-for-android) just to check how this all works. You don't need to buy real BTC for that. It's more or less the same on the mainnet.

2018-06-03,"Ive been watching crypto since last year's spike and fall and have decided to purchase some to hold onto for awhile. I like the idea of having some available for payments in a wallet on my phone. But I want to store most of it securely.

What's the simplest way to make a cold storage wallet with 1 or 2 backups.

I am not incredibly technical. But can usually google my way through problems. But with all my research I am undecided on what would be best for me and unclear on how it actually works.

Currently I have about $1000 value of bitcoin in the cash app and I want to move it to wallets pronto.

I know no one can tell me exactly what to do. As that largely depends on how paranoid I am. 

But what would be one simple scenario to move my coin from the cash app to a secure offline wallet to hold?"
2018-06-03,"\&gt;alternative sprawl is natural development when new market appears.  creating an alt coin became easy, so whole bunch of scammers moved in  with bullshit marketing. this has nothing to do with blocksize limit.

I completely disagree. If BTC had been a place where innovation was possible, it would have maintained its market dominance. Instead it went from 80&amp;#37; to 40&amp;#37; in a year. The BTC team capped blocksize, and because of it many services are no longer possible on BTC. Op\_return data was reduced much to the same effect. 

&gt;Segwit does not use blockchain more efficiently

\&gt;it does.

I'm not sure how you think it does. But in terms of node requirements it's actually much less efficient. Your node has to be resistant to 4MB for only 1.7x potential capacity increase in capacity otherwise it create an attack vector. [https://imgur.com/a/LwL0e](https://imgur.com/a/LwL0e). The result is that segwit offers 1.7 units of scale for 4 units of cost. Segwit is less efficient in the ways that matter. I'm not entirely sure how you think it's more efficient in any way.

\&gt;bitcoin is financial ledger. we should and need to be making judgments  about non\-financial use\-cases of it. especially if one can use  merge\-mining to achieve their goal of having a blockchain with whatever  bullshit they want to place in there \(like memo\).

Honestly if you just want a purely financial service something like Nano is better. And that's part of the problem with BTC and the Lightning Network, it's easier to move to altcoins than to use LN.  
When a transaction is submitted and a fee is paid, the miners are being paid to store that information. Anything that pays the price is valid. With more use cases the value of whichever coin it is goes up and the miners are paid more. Unless the coin is a bubble and the value is detached from its usability. And before you say BTC is a store of value, the value of BTC came from its use as a means of exchange. If it's a shitty currency its worth is going to decline, making it also a shitty store of value. 

I notice you don't comment on the lack of ability of people in third world countries to use BTC. What is your priority for a cryptocurrency? Is it purely the health of the network in terms of how decentralized it is? Remember that decentralization is simply a means to robustness. The level of decentralization that you desire will price people in third world countries out of using BTC entirely. What we need is money for the world.  
\&gt;there is no free cheese. bitcoin is the ground layer to trustless  banking systems. safe and stable ground layer is way more important than  immediate adoption numbers. future of money is more important than  marketing campaigns of the present.

We have had ""free cheese"" for the past 6 or 7 years before the blocksize limit was held at 1mb. Lets remember that 1mb was an arbitrary number decided years ago when computers were much less powerful. We can now easily run 32mb blocks on a home computer. A great example I heard was that it costs less to run full 8mb blocks for a year than to do one singular BTC transaction at the height of its fees. That gives you an idea of how much technology has increased, and how bad the fees were \(and will again be\). "

Hopefully people are willing to discuss this. Competition for lowest fees is good for everyone. (I think the answer is BCH needs more hashing power, but I am not an expert.)

http://fortune.com/2018/02/10/arizona-bitcoin-taxes/"
2018-06-03,"LMAO I'm literally cracking up. Not just figuratively, had a good laugh when I read your post.

&gt;""argument from authority""

I suspected you'd throw that in my face. Except it's not... because I offered the real argument above. I described my argument in detail above, so I'm allowed to bring in people who agree with me.

But I like that you're admitting the role of full nodes...

&gt;The problem with your reasoning -- and the way Garzik expresses himself in the above citation -- is that you overemphasize nonmining clients to the point that hashpower means nothing and having as well as setting your own nodes consensus rule means everything.

See, I never said it means ""nothing"". But it means A LOT more than this sub, in general, and you in particular seem to acknowledge. It's obvious that mining power is necessary to extend the chain and time-stamp txs, nobody ever denied that. But the key role non-mining nodes have is to answer ""Who keeps the miners honest?"" In other words, what's to prevent miners to increase the money supply? Because if miners can increase the money supply as they wish, that's central banking 2.0. So what prevents that? Keep in mind, they ALL benefit from it - It's not like only some miners would benefit. So what keeps them in check? Fully validating nodes.

This is the essence of Jeff's quote above - If nodes collectively refuse your blocks, you can't do anything. And yes, it's true that the network will slow down, that's undeniable and not controversial. But the key point to note is that miners **don't get paid** for blocks that are not relayed, because they don't extend the chain. And that's the flip side of ""what keeps miners honest"" - It's money, not goodwill, like many here claim.

It then becomes a race - Who can sustain the stubbornness for longer. Full nodes ort miners? The former are running RasPis @ $10/mo (my personal estimated cost), or miners paying ~$2,000/bitcoin in electricity and other costs. What do you think?

The analogy here is US accountants starting to do taxes according to Canadian rules. The IRS won't accept them, and clients won't pay them. Who do you think will cave first, the US economy or the accountants, with families to support??

&gt;It doesn't work like that. The network is run by doing all of the above. Nonmining nodes can be set up in the thousands and still be worthless except to whoever thinks they gain value by setting them up.

I think I cleared the interaction between mining and non-mining nodes above.

&gt;Yet again you presume too much. You'll see I've probably never made any such remarks. I've talked some about Blockstream and their role in the ecosystem as well as the products they develop, but I don't see them as an ""evil entity""

I'll admit it was a generalization, it seems to give a hard on to many here. I stand corrected and apologize. But i'll also be looking forward to your counter claims when the inevitable next Core/Blockstream/AXA/Bilderberg post pops up.

&gt;There's nothing wrong with talking with people. They are human beings too. As are you. Even if you still are troll of course... ;)

I'll admit that I get some entertainment out of this, but far from being a troll. My arguments are on point, and not very many can actually engage me fully. Just consider the completely misinformed junk that gets posted!

If it sounds pompous it so because it's true. And I'll still happily take the label, I consider it a compliment ;-)

2018-06-03,"My point is everyone has a different definition of the word moon, or in other words, every one has a different price point where they feel it makes sense to start spending it because it might drop in the future. Your point only makes sense if people know the future. Nobody does. Maybe your $100k price point is a terrible time to spend it because maybe shortly after you spend a bunch of bitcoin at $100k it goes to $500k all of a sudden, or maybe it never reaches that price point at all so you're left losing value while waiting for a price that never happens. And everybody's goal price is different, because nobody knows the future.

Yeah if it were to go to $1 million and you sold it all you will miss out on lots of gains sure. But that is IF! Nobody knows the future. Nobody knows how high it will end up going or when the best time to sell or spend is. Its just each person's individual choice. If you had sold or spent some of it at $19k in december that would have been a fantastic time to spend it because then you could just rebuy all that bitcoin now for less than half the price.

If a reality where we don't know what the future is, which is the only reality that exists, there is no ""waiting for it to moon"" because ""moon"" is different for everybody. People wait until it has appreciated enough where they are happy to start spending it. That is the only choice to make. There's no guarantee that Bitcoin becomes the world's reserve currency, so simply holding indefinitely isn't necessarily the best move. Generally people want to hedge their bets.

For instance I plan on selling some of my Bitcoin around $75k because I think that is a good price point goal for the next couple of years, and doing that will give me enough to set up a nice diversified retirement account. I'm not going to not sell any of it then just in the hope that it keeps going up. I'll have hit a goal price (one of my own personal ""moon"" prices) and so I'm ready to cash out some. And if it goes higher later I'll still have plenty left to cash out or to spend. But if I had bought a few hundred bitcoin back when it was like $50, maybe my goal price would have been $10k and I'd be perfectly happy spending my Bitcoin now.

Like I already explained, people don't know the future, so there is no guaranteed price point ""moon"" that all we have to do is wait and then that'll be the perfect time to start spending our bitcoin. Every person is going to spend at different price points, regardless or what the unforeseeable future holds precisely because it is unforeseeable.

Let's just summarize:
It is useful to spend your bitcoin when you are happy with what you have made from bitcoin. Period. For some people that might have been $1000. For some people that might be right now. For some people $100k. For some people $1 million. Every one is different. Since we all bought in at different times, all have different goals for how much money we want to make, and all have different goals for what we want to spend the money on, any price point can be a good time for people to spend Bitcoin, depending on those factors. There is no specific price where it becomes useful or not useful for everyone to spend bitcoin."

2018-06-03,"Not entirely wrong, but more than 50&amp;#37; is indeed a probabilistic threshold. Short intuitive explanation with some high school calculus: as x\-\&gt;\+Infinity, \(0.51 / 0.49\)\^x\-\&gt;\+Infinity while \(0.49 / 0.51\)\^x\-\&gt;0. Longer version is in the original bitcoin whitepaper. If your hashrate is slightly lower than 50&amp;#37;, the probability of controlling longer chains decreases exponentially with chain length. But if you are ... like super super lucky, it's theoretically possible to double spend with your phone's hash rate."

But I think also in nearly 20 years time, Digicash might have solved the problem if it were able to survive long enough. The pure reason for it’s failure was not due to tech, but due to market timing. Even if Bitcoin, with better tech, launched in 1990; I believe it would have failed. There simply wasn’t enough support, knowledge, application, or need at the time.  That’s all I’m saying.

2018-06-03,[yes](np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/8ob079/there_is_now_a_23_mb_backlog_in_the_btc_mempool/)
2018-06-03,"First of all, you should be more careful when phrasing your questions in the future.  By saying things such as ""simple bitcoin network design"" and ""IOU token network design"" you're demonstrating a clear opinion and poisoning the question.  There is no such thing as an ""IOU Token"" in BTC or LN, and if you believe that there is then I suspect the remainder of this post will fail to resonate with you, but unfortunately I do not have the time right now to refute that belief.  My only recommendation would be to use the LN yourself and put those beliefs to the test.

However, I will answer the question that I believe you were asking, which is: ""Based on your experience using both LN and BCH, which do you think is a better approach?""  Feel free to correct me if my interpretation of your question is inaccurate.

BCH has made some design decisions that are targetted at solving the issues Bitcoin is facing right now.  But I remain unconvinced that these decisions will solve the issues BCH will face if it were ever to achieve the network adoption that the oft-maligned BTC has today.  I'm speaking mostly about the Minimum Competetive Fee issue that I've discussed at some length in this sub before, but there are some other concerns for which I have not yet developed a level of understanding necessary to feel comfortable commenting on at this time.  To be sure, I fully understand that BTC has exactly the same problem and that BTC will be forced to come to grips with that issue much sooner due to the smaller blocks.

LN aims to solve both the block space and the fee issue in ""one fel swoop."" However, as you agree, LN adds a great deal of complexity to the system, and crypto is already complex enough as it is.  It makes a lot of grandiose claims, and I do not know if it will be able to live up to all of them once the system achieves something like 30% network effect or more.  Based on my personal experiences, and things such as the fact that LN does not specify a routing algorithm, so different wallet vendors are not locked into a single implementation, grant me great optimism for the future of LN, but I remain skeptical while the system is in ""beta.""

I do apologize if I gave the impression that I was promoting the system to anyone, my intent was simply to clarify some of the misinformation that is often thrown around in this and other threads on this sub.  I will not deny that I believe it is a viable **idea**, but I do not yet know if it is a viable **implementation**, if you understand what I'm saying.  Similarly, I also believe that pure on-chain-only scaling is a viable **idea**, but reserve judgment on if BCH is a viable **implementation** of that idea.  I support both, and do not believe that they are mutually-exclusive approaches.  Hell, the LN whitepaper itself even states that a successful LN would require larger blocks on the main chain.

Insofar as complexity goes, every single crypto-currency to date is more complicated than fiat, so I do not consider that to be a viable comparison.  Consider the difference between the ease of using Venmo compared to setting up and securing your own HD wallet.  This is purely a UX issue, and will be solved in time.  Given that I'm a UI Software Architect, studying solutions to this is where I spend most of my time."

2018-06-03,"Eh - agree to disagree. Digicash, created in 1990, put forth the first digital transaction using crypto in 1994. By 1999 they were bankrupt. The tech wasn’t a failure - they went bankrupt due to the “chicken or the egg” scenario. They couldn’t line up enough retailers to accept the currency, therefore any potential consumers lost interest. Back then, not many people transacted online. The idea was ahead of it’s time.

The US markets were also solid during this time. People’s faith in USD, and banks in general, were strong. There was no “need” for people to create exchanges to trade Digicash in the off chance that the experiment took off. Not many ordinary people could even comprehend how the tech even worked. Compared to today, not many people were even using email at the time, much less ready to transact online for goods and services. Hotmail didn’t even launch until 1996; two years after the first Digicash transaction.

Bitcoin is superior to Digicash - no doubt. But it also came around almost 20 years later and at a time that e-commerce was rampant and also in the year following one of the worst financial markets he world had seen in nearly 80 years. Better tech - but even better timing. "

2018-06-03,"Mainly it improves your own security. If you run a full node, there are no tricks that a malicious 3rd party could do to attack you.

The other benefit is that it makes the network more robust. It is much harder to knock 1000 computers off the internet than it is to knock 100 off. Some of the latest DDOS attacks that have been have had enough bandwidth behind them that they could send a gigabit of traffic at every known bitcoin node. If that ever happened, bitcoin \(or any altcoin\) would struggle to have the nodes stay connected."
2018-06-03,"LN's ""success"" outcome is one where people buy LN coins on an exchange, and then move those coins around without ever going on-chain.   In such a future, the limited blockspace will still become arbitrarily expensive.   If on-chain transactions cost $10, $100, or $1000, this effectively means on-chain is unusable for anyone other than for those LN hubs (banks &amp; exchanges) to settle.    The decision to rely on such schemes to scale BTC very intentionally subverted the large portion of the community who believed Bitcoin should scale on-chain.   This is a far more wide reaching impact than one payment processor adopting a payment protocol standard.   What Bitpay did is no different than Apple adopting standards like Firewire or Thunderbolt.

- XBT is used as the [example currency](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/payments/deep-dive-into-payment-request) in their payment request API.  

- They also hardcoded the keyword ""bitcoin"" into Google trends back at the beginning, way before anyone was actually searching on it.

A white paper is a document that contains the basic information on a coin. White papers have become a custom in the world of cryptocurrencies since Satoshi Nakamoto first revealed Bitcoin’s white paper to cryptographers and economists. Since Bitcoin, most cryptocurrency teams have been writing white paper detailing information on their coin, the technology, use-cases, roadmaps, development teams, and more. If you want to invest in a project, it is a good idea to read the white paper."

2018-06-03,"I'm sorry; I do actually appreciate the efforts you and Fly115 have expended to try to explain LN to me, and the above does help somewhat, but I think, like him, you're still missing my most basic point: you're describing the nature of the Lightning Network RIGHT NOW. You're explaining why, AS CURRENTLY DESIGNED, the Lightning Network channels funded by x number of BTC are as good as x number of BTC, and why no one can create something like ""LN BTC channel credit"" without actually owning the appropriate number of BTC, because their ownership will be repeatedly checked against the BTC blockchain AS LN IS CURRENTLY DESIGNED.

What I'm asking (again and again) is what stops anyone from changing the design of the LN?

Put it this way: suppose LN hubs have centralized to a not extreme but not insignificant degree in the US at some point in the future. Let's say the majority of LN transactions go through one of 1000 hubs, most of which are connected to major, well-known companies (that is, the government can fine them, take them to court, etc.). Also, a large number of devs for Lightning Labs and others working on LN physically reside in the US. I am a US Senate subcommittee chairman and have just created a taskforce of government agents funded by a new bill that got passed. You are the lead agent of this new taskforce. The mission: change the fundamental design of LN (including its relationship to the BTC chain) so that it is possible for the federal government to open LN channels for more ""BTC credit"" than it actually holds BTC at any one time. Remember, we have the power to threaten the major node operators and developers with prison, and/or hire new ones if they won't help us achieve this. What makes you tell me, ""Senate subcommittee chairperson that, this mission is impossible?"""

2018-06-03,"I am optimistic about the long term prospects of Bitcoin. It sounds like you've looked at its history - I'm not sure if there has ever been a more volatile asset than Bitcoin, so keep in mind that over the short-to-medium term, the worth of your Bitcoin may go far up or far down. I think in the long-term it will go up much higher, but it could still go to almost nothing. 

If you buy Bitcoin, make sure that you are extremely careful - move it to a private wallet (look up cold storage for anything you're not hoping to spend).

Keep track of how much you buy and what the cost is. 

Regarding timing the market, this is notoriously difficult - Bitcoin's history is littered with people who made some money day-trading, only to lose on unexpected swings. People here will often find a short-lived pattern that soon vanishes, and many people will confidently predict what will happen in the short term, despite how often they are wrong. 

If you're interested in investing in general, buying index funds that track whole markets is an excellent choice. These tend to have low expense ratios (much lower than traditional mutual funds), and over the long term have consistently done well. View Bitcoin as something with a great deal of potential and risk - try balancing this out with some other investments."

Bitcoin has nowhere near the usage needed to test this empirically. It never will. Bitcoin cash is a hardfork of bitcoin."

2018-06-03,"I can understand how you've come to that view given the stories that circulate  social media, but it's really not true. The Bitcoin Cash fork originated from *within* the Bitcoin community after years of debate about what Bitcoin should be and how it should scale. Those who favoured Satoshi's big block scaling model were locked out of development by individuals who censored discussion forums and revoked developer access to the code base. 

Bitcoin Cash was created by this exiled faction. I don't believe that the idea of ""Bitcoin"" is anybody's to police, nor is it Core’s to ruin. The people in *this* community \(the original big\-block bitcoiners\) have as much right to work on ensuring the success of Satoshi’s idea as anyone else. 

Plus, tipping on reddit is what btc used to be like too. Electronic cash should be able to do that, don't you think? And who can deny that it's fun?"
2018-06-03,"I don't usually agree with Garzik, so no surprise there really. But the gist of what he's saying is accurate, because here we are. Bitcoin Cash. He probably wasn't blinded by ideology and I think we would have agreed if I had sat down with him.

The problem with your reasoning -- and the way Garzik expresses himself in the above citation -- is that you overemphasize nonmining clients to the point that hashpower means nothing and having as well as setting your own nodes consensus rule means everything. 

It doesn't work like that. The network is run by doing all of the above. Nonmining nodes can be set up in the thousands and still be worthless except to whoever thinks they gain value by setting them up.

We can trade OTC and some people would be fine in a completely no\-fiat environment. Exchanges are and always were the main evil. But I still think that at this stage the worst thing about exchanges is not the channel to let fiat dominate our minds yet again but that token scams are so successful exactly because they exploit this fake affinity to securities. Scammers pretend to ""be concerned about potential violation of securities regulations"". However, that is a huge untapped honour because what they commit is an ordinary crime of running a fraud scheme, not a “noble act of an innovative crypto anarchist to fail registering a security with ruthless government”. And, by the way, not meaning to ruin all I said above, if exchanges are shut down, in a while, the new balanced ""price"" of bitcoin \(whatever what it is calculated then\) would be much higher than it is today because all the crap would die off."

It would seem that you don't actually know what you care about. Nice mobile goal posts though! :D"
2018-06-03,"&gt;So you admit that the title is wildly misleading?

No. I just didn't attack it from the angle you expected.

&gt; I believe they are exactly like cash. It's just a normal Bitcoin transaction between two people, but since we plan to send back and forth to each other we just send the final balance once when we're finished. All secured by exactly the same trustless technology as Bitcoin.

Except it's easy to see that the transactions you made in LN are nothing like ordinary Bitcoin transactions, since the network topology is completely different.

&gt;There's always going to be some people with more Bitcoin than others, and therefore more ability to stake coins in channels to earn, but we all play on a level playing field, they have no more ability to do things than anyone else.

This is not about blaming anyone for having too much money. I'm an anarcho-capitalist after all. This is about exposing the weakpoints of the security mode, which in an adversarial environment happens to be centralized points of failure. This specific issue that LN has with routing was carefully avoided in Satoshis Bitcoin design.

&gt;But You are transacting in exactly the same currency.

No you are not. You are transacting in cryptographically backed promissory notes. They may be cryptographically backed, but they are what they are.

&gt;Try applying your logic to physical coins.

Physical coins are not Bitcoin and transacting in them is not making a Bitcoin transaction. The collectors items with keys to a Bitcoin address are just that. Safer in some regards than LN and worse in others, but always a physical coin with keys to an address.  

&gt;It's irrelevant where the signatures are stored as long as I have access to them and I can 100% verify that they are valid on the blockchain.

It's not irrelevant if it means that you never actually make a Bitcoin transaction. 

An analogy, would be that trading bitcoins on a centralized exchange for example, is not the same as holding your bitcoins. You get the to think that you do and experience most of the benefits, but until you actually have the keys to a safe address, you don't hold them. 

Same goes for transactions. Bitcoin transactions take place on the Bitcoin network and nowhere else."

The same questions were popping up then... let's see what Jeff had to say:

&amp;nbsp;

Question:

&gt;&gt;Would it be possible to force a blockchain change without having the processing power to backup that block chain switch?

Answer:

&gt;*There is no ""force"", there is choice.  Each user chooses the software they run to validate the chain.  If a majority of users choose to switch to SHA-512, that is what will happen, regardless of the number of miners who switch.*

&gt;*51% hashing power, or even 90%, means nothing if clients collectively refuse to accept and relay your blocks.*

 --- Jeff Garzik, July 14, 2012

See full thread on [bitcointalk.org](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=93366.msg1031394#msg1031394).

What gives??? Jeff seems to be saying the same thing as myself!! And, of course, you'll remember that the community turned against Jeff last year, as he was trying to force S2X. Hardly a ""Core fanboy"", is he? Hmmm....


&amp;nbsp;

But I'm sure even Jeff was just blinded by ideology, just like me. And he was blinded by it 6 years ago, you know that same ideology that wants to cripple Bitcoin because Core/Blockstream/AXA/Bilderberg. Which was a thing even back then, even though it was established much later ;-)"

I get some of your logic, people being inept and sending bch to a btc address etc must cause issues, but I wish there was some sort of advanced mode where it just gave me an address to send to, as I have done many times before.

It doesn't help that this change isn't that well communicated. I got to the final screen with the QR code and was looking for the link that used to be there to send the payment manually.

I then plugged a webcam in that I had to dig out of the loft to try to scan the QR code into the ledger app (obviously that didn't work), before copying the link into notepad hoping I would find a wallet address.

It all became a massive saga, and I now know I hate electrum, but I feel like there was more chance of me messing up and losing coins going through this process of juggling wallets than there was on the old process."

2018-06-03,"Hi, /u/ault92. James from BitPay here. We're sorry to hear you had trouble paying from your Ledger wallet – our goal isn't to stop anyone from paying with Bitcoin (we only succeed as a business when people can pay). 

We are working to make adoption of Payment Protocol easier for other wallets (including hardware wallets), and we have made a [simpler version of Payment Protocol](https://blog.bitpay.com/json-payment-protocol/) available for easy implementation. We'll be posting updates soon as more wallets make this secure payment option available. 

In the meantime, [here is a walkthrough](https://support.bitpay.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000245586-How-to-Pay-a-BitPay-Invoice-with-a-Hardware-Wallet-and-Desktop-Electrum-Wallet) for using Ledger with a secure Payment Protocol wallet. Please let us know if there is anything we can clarify or explain better! 

Our choice to require payments from [secure Payment Protocol wallets](https://support.bitpay.com/hc/en-us/articles/115005701523) wasn't arbitrary.  We made the switch to protect purchasers and merchants from the cost of payment mistakes and guarantee a successful payment experience. Across the BitPay platform, various failed payments and overpayments once ranged between several percentage points to up to 10% of payments processed. After Payment Protocol, that percentage is now less than 1/10th of a percent. Payment Protocol wallets work, and they prevent serious problems that can discourage people from using Bitcoin for commerce payments: https://blog.bitpay.com/bitpay-and-payment-protocol/

That said, we're sorry we didn't communicate this clearly enough to prevent confusion for you when you went to checkout on updated BitPay invoices. That's on us, and we take responsibility to make the payment experience as simple and seamless as possible. Thank you for your feedback! "

There's always going to be some people with more Bitcoin than others, and therefore more ability to stake coins in channels to earn, but we all play on a level playing field, they have no more ability to do things than anyone else. 

As for transacting on a different network, yes, You are. But You are transacting in exactly the same currency. You have the signatures that represent unspent outputs.

2018-06-03,"well, it exploded because of the 40 USD transaction fees on the bitcoin network at the end of 2017.

and it's not that it's a few seconds faster than other coins, most other coins take minutes to hours to complete a transaction (it's very likely that a Bitcoin transaction takes over an hour).
granted, bitcoin is pretty much the worst case here, but instant is way better from a user experience point of view than even just 1 minute.

for paying in person, more than 10 seconds is unacceptable.
for paying online, the longer the user has to wait the more likely they are to be paranoid as hell about inputting the wrong address or similar, and it just slows down the process.

now let's get to fees: if you want to buy something for 20 cents, paying another.. say 20 cents for transaction fees sounds pretty ridiculous. for bigger transactions it's not a huge issue of course, but for especially for people in poorer countries crypto fees can be quite high, especially when they are actually being used, just like December 2017.

Also its just nice to be able to move funds without losing some of them each time you do so. and at the same time it's instant. it's just a way better experience.

ETH
LTC

BAT

BTC is the most secure and robust of all the coins with the strongest developer support, so it's clear the #1 option for most of us.

ETH's dApp ecosystem is a cauldron of innovation in the space that is sufficiently differentiated.  I'm excited to see what comes out of hte space.

LTC has proven it can fit within and complement the entire cryptospace.  LTC scaled with Lightning appears to be a winning solution for scaling small payment transactions in the greater bitcoin ecosystem.

NEO has a lot of the same appeal as ETH and the payout in Gas makes it an attractive investment.

BAT, if scaled right, could topple Google and Facebook's advertising empire.  The development team is solid, the Brave browser looks beautiful and concept is appealing.  I am skeptical about their ability to successfully pull off the BAT model but if it's successful we're talking a multi-billion ad market they can disrupt with a solution that improves privacy, security and ad delivery.

2018-06-03,"They tried to say the year long ICO was about distribution and preventing cartels but they know cartels can't be prevented. The real reason for the year long ICO was to make as much profit as possible and to allow behind the scenes accumulation. Block.One has officially stated that ICO proceeds are all profit. The vast majority of this money will not be going to development of the platform (unlike most ICOs which at least use the ICO to fund development - not line the owner's pockets). I hope Dan and his father Stan end up in jail for flaunting Securities laws. I hope you all know Stan Larimer was behind the AriseBank scam. Look it up.

https://medium.com/@arnold_90210/stan-larimer-and-michael-taggart-actively-promoted-arise-bank-see-multiple-posts-on-medium-b11a1b34be57

Block.one, Dan Larimer, and Dan's father have been selling ETH constantly and buying up a large percentage of all circulating EOS behind the scenes. The reason for doing this is twofold. dPOS systems will always devolve into a couple of cartels holding a majority/controlling amount of the tokens because of the intrinsic financial incentive to do so. Tokens in a dPOS system have not only their base trading value (the amount a token can be sold for on Binance at any given time) but an additional value in the equity they represent in the Block Producer positions. The block producer spots are the most valuable thing in the EOS ecosystem by far and are the main benefactors of the annual inflation (after 30+ years there will be far more coins created through inflation than exist right now. The current supply will be a drop in the bucket so you can see how important/powerful these BP spots are. 5% annual inflation). Small and medium holders of EOS tokens will never realize any of this BP equity - they simply have no shot of ever becoming producers. They may receive a small kick back from a BP for their vote is all. A large portion of the value in the EOS token will be wasted on most holders. As the large holders accumulate/control more tokens the value of their tokens rise collectively and exponentially (rather than linearly as would be the case with token accumulation of for example BTC) because they will realize an increasing amount of the BP equity from their holdings. Eventually cartels form that hold so many tokens that they can always vote themselves in, act with relative impunity, and never be displaced by opposing parties and at this point the cartel is realizing 100% of their token's BP equity because the cartel owns the block producer spots and gathers all of the block rewards (without having to distribute portions of the rewards for support).

So you see here the flaw with dPOS and why the economics dictate that tokens will pool into huge individual groups over time in order to maximize their value/utility for the holder. The Larimer Gang knows this. They have seen what has happened with other dPOS projects like LISK and even their own creations Bitshares and STEEM. Dan knows the only way to prevent this is to basically beat everyone else to the punch. Dan himself is accumulating a controlling share of EOS tokens. This way he can control the BP spots himself or at least prevent anyways else from gaining undue influence. He will be able to maintain a semblance of decentralization while controlling EOS from behind the scenes.

BTW, The year long ICO wasn't created to prevent cartels from forming. That is nonsense. Cartels form over time because of the dPOS incentive system; they aren't just made by single groups buying a ton out of the intial ico supply. Initial distribution in the dPOS case doesn't even matter much because while a more even distribution may slow the formation of cartels it will not prevent it because the flow of tokens over time will be the same either way; they will aggregate into large single holdings where their value is maximized. If token x is worth more to person A than to Person B, then x will tend to flow from B to A over time. Simple as that. The reason for the year long ICO is so that Block.One and Dan can more easily disguise their own accumulation. It doesn't matter to them what the cost of the EOS token is because they are buying using the ICO ETH. The more EOS costs during any given phase of the ICO the more ETH they gain during that period to offset the rising cost. They can buy the same amount of EOS each round no matter the price without ever digging into their own pockets. They are the only participant that is unaffected by the rising costs over time in this style ICO making it much easier for them to accumulate a large stake than for other interested parties."

While yes, some people had to buy ETH to get ETH, a significant percentage would instead use their ETH to buy EOS, because they believe it's the better investment.  People don't just keep the same ratio of coins, and most people who own more than 1 crypto, own some ethereum.  So many coins that people were holding in ETH, were convinced that EOS was the better platform, and if you're convinced of that, why would you hold ETH?  Even if it was some world where everyone had to purchase new ETH to participate in the EOS ico, they would still be selling those investors on the idea that EOS is better, and they'd take a convince a good percentage of them that, which will at least lower if not eliminate their eth holdings.  

It's fine to assume that they didn't act with that intent, I'd completely disagree with that though because while it may not be the main reason, and it's obviously not the only reason, it's definitely a positive result that they considered and appreciated when planning the ICO.  "

As I write, once most transactions happen in the second layer it starts to become socially viable to influence politics enough to where settlement becomes impossible. This is aided a great deal by the necessary creation of ""hubs"" or ""key players"" on the network.

Having a signed transaction that represents several does not make up for the fact that you transacted in a completely different network. You may see it as the same network and it's not entirely important to get into the exact distinction here, but the take away is that you expose yourself to risks that simply don't exist with a regular Bitcoin topology and transaction.

That is every person's individual decision to make. There's no paradox there. It's no different than any other investment. At some point you make the decision to actually use (or sell) your bitcoin in order to realize its value. Everyone has a different point at which they'll decide the price is high enough that it is worth spending. Some people spend now, some people will spend at $20k, or $40k , or $100k, or $200k, etc. Nobody knows just how high Bitcoin will go. Maybe it'll get up to $90k but then fail to ultimately catch on as a method of payment and people will get out of it and that's the peak price it gets too and you were planning on waiting to spend it only when it is above $100k so you missed out. And why choose $100k? Why not choose $200k? Because that is your own personal choice, everybody can make their own choice of when it makes sense, weighing the current reward of the current value vs the risk of the unknown future, to decide when to spend it. Not a paradox, just a choice that everyone gets to make on their own."

https://www.youtube.com/user/aantonop/search?query=consensus


"
2018-06-03,"Yes, Bitcoin is peer-to-peer in that every transaction is broadcast over the network of connected nodes, and each node performs validation of those transactions, forwarding on valid transactions and dropping invalid transactions.

Miners (who could be any node) include valid transactions into blocks, which they perform PoW on to demonstrate that they're not just creating blocks out of thin air - the work is extremely difficult to reproduce, making it impractical for them to just craft any old block.

When miners create the valid block, they then broadcast it over the same network. Each node will perform full validation of the block and the transactions within it. If the block is valid, they accept it onto the chain of blocks, and forward it on to other nodes.

If the block is invalid, they would refuse to forward it on. They would wait then until a different miner provides a competing, but valid block, which they would then accept as the correct one and forward it on to everyone else.

Miners need to broadcast *valid* blocks, or they're going to get kicked off the network of nodes. They don't strictly need to include any transactions in those blocks, which could lead to a kind of temporary denial-of-service, but they are incentivized to include as many transactions as they can in a block because they earn fees from each tx.

It's possible that an adversary could spawn many nodes and attempt to spread invalid blocks by overpowering the network of honest nodes, but they can never coerce an honest node to begin accepting invalid blocks, so as long as you are running an honest node, you do not need to worry about whether you are conducing your transactions on the honest network of users - that guarantee is provided by your software which does all of the validation.

If you're not running a validating node, none of the above applies - you are dependant on third-parties to be honest in certain ways which you aren't testing for yourself."

2018-06-03,"&gt; LN isn't a sidechain, its a competing chain seeking to replace Bitcoin transactions entirely. 

This is a pretty strange statement, considering that the LN is inherently designed to rely on the Bitcoin blockchain as a settlement layer. The blockchain serves as a tool for resolving disputes between parties, so that nobody can double spend or cheat in some other way.

Moreover, how do you imagine buying a car or a house via the Lightning Network? The channels simply do not have enough capacity for really large payments. The on-chain transactions are not going away. But a bulk of small everyday payments can happen on the second layer without unnecessarily burdening the blockchain.

&gt; When you fund a lightning channel, you're using lightning tokens that are backed by Bitcoins.

There is no such thing as lightning tokens. All the LN payments are denominated in Bitcoins. And the LN uses unpublished Bitcoin transactions to keep track of the channel balances."

From contracts, to purposely attacking and trying to draw people away from btc, along with in the times that BTC prices were so lovely, it was used to buy other crypto. Now exchanges are starting to make more and more options for usd to other currencies making it less of a necessity to get btc as it was in past. 

I’m definitely hoping some of these big predictions are true, but with how much things have changed since the good old days I’m optimistic about the ranges peaking so high. "
2018-06-03,"We are in a hypothetical future, the year is 2032. Cryptocurrencies have been an astounding success. Most pre-2020 investors are filthy rich now, fiat is still used in some places and for paying taxes, but the vast majority of commerce is done in crypto. LN has become everything it was promised to be and has gained massive worldwide adoption. Most of the early BTC users are still running their own fully-validating nodes and cheering for decentralization. The on-chain fees are massive, but noone really cares about it, since it's rare for a normal user to transact on-chain. On-chain tx is only used for onboarding someone to LN, and the poorer users who cannot afford even a single on-chain fee use centralized but time-proven trustworthy services to hold their funds and allow them to transact on LN. Meanwhile, BCH chain has also been thriving equally well. The value of BCH is about the same as the value of BTC. Everyone on BCH side is transacting on-chain with low fees and BCH blocks are measured in many gigabytes. Because of resource requirements, BCH nodes are mostly run by miners, exchanges and other large businesses, and rich BCH enthusiasts, the rest using either SPV nodes or. BCH is still being ridiculed by BTC users as  a centralized miner-controlled coin. Who knows what's even going on in their chain, almost noone is validating it.

Block halvening has just occured and the new coinbase for both BTC and BCH is 0.78125 BTC/BCH per block. But there is a problem. The total amount of block reward for miners on BTC chain is ~2 BTC, fees included. 2 BTC at year 2032 price levels is a huge amount indeed, but the block reward on BCH with it's huge centralized blocks averages 4-5 BCH. This means that the majority of SHA256 miners are mining BCH. Some very trusted Bitcoin Core developers put out a serious PSA — Jihan Wu controlled mining cabal is controlling more than 100% of BTC hashrate, currently mining on BCH chain. They raise the concern that Jihan Wu has been a long-time enemy of BTC and already tried to destroy BTC 14 years ago. Now they have the means to do that at any point by performing an attack on BTC, compromising any LN channel settlement they wish, even ones that were buried under many blocks. This is a huge risk not only to on-chain BTC, but also to LN. The trustworthy developers announce that, after long discussions and weighing of all the risks, they propose to remove LN dependency from on-chain settlement. Many people object, but the vast majority understand that, even though they would prefer not to do that, it is the lesser of two evils. Risking a complete wipeout of any settlement transactions at any time at Jihan's will, is far more risky for a globally-adopted payment network, than removing the on-chain layer. Other options were considered, such as changing the PoW, but that only postpones the problem — if one entity could control so much hashpower once, it can in time happen again with different PoW. Yet other options were considered, but upon deeper inspection, also contained serious potential flaws or threats to decentralization. Besides, only the settlement layer is being removed, people rarely have to use it anyway. If anything, it makes BTC better, since now we won't have to spend to pay those pesky miners their huge settlement fees to onboard new users — a different, free way is proposed to onboard new users. The LN is still BTC and no additional LN tokens are being created, so the supply is still limited, right? Right. For now.. Well, we might just recreate the BTC tokens that have been long lost, are not on LN, and haven't been used for 12 years, since they won't be able to be used on a non-existing chain anyway. But just that..

I think I have another different hypothetical scenario, but I have to think about it and it is way too late here to type it out now."
2018-06-03,"I'll give you an example, but let me preface it with this (very) long intro:

Bitcoin as per it's original design is a relatively simple and easy-to-understand design. It might not be trivial to understand for everyone on the planet, but for anyone with some technological and economic understanding, it's relatively simple to read the whitepaper and understand the details, incentives, and economics of the system. The current economic system, on the other hand, is deliberately complex and hard to understand. This is intentional, because the less people understand the details, the easier it is for its controllers to implement mechanisms to siphon off some funds, for example in the form of fractional reserve banking, and do this without massive protests by the laypeople they are effectively robbing. I'll call these controlling entities and their partners ""The Powers That Be"" (TPTB), and actually, with regards to the argument I'm making, it doesn't matter if TPTB are the same that are controlling fiat system, or a different group, but I think there is no doubt that there are many powerful entities that want to control Bitcoin and extract value from it for themselves at the expense of everyone else.

Bitcoin is a bad system for TPTB for many reasons, and one of these reasons is it's relative simplicity. You can't easily implement in this system something that would benefit you at the expense of others, because most users understand the system and will protest your proposed change.

Enter SegWit. SegWit makes Bitcoin more complex. Not by a huge margin, since the main change can be written in one sentence ""separate signatures out of transactions and store them alongside the transcation block"". But Bitcoin with SegWit is undoubtedly more complex than Bitcoin without SegWit. It also introduces some other slight changes such as fee discount for SegWit trancations. It being a soft-fork also makes it have more complex code than it would have been, had it been a hard-fork. But it's all good, right? Even if it's a bit more complex, most people have at least rudimentary understanding of what it does, many smart Bitcoiners still understand all its details, and the benefits far outweight the costs, since it fixes transaction malleability, enables further implementations like Lightning Network, all while avoiding a risky hard-fork and without compromising ordinary users ability to run non-mining full nodes.

Now add Lightning Network. It's a really smart idea promising cheap, instant peer-to-peer payments off-chain, with potentially unlimited scaling potential, while still requiring all funds to be cryptographicaly backed by BTC and unrevokably tied to the main chain on a 1-to-1 basis. A magnificent solution to the scaling problem, which promises to not only solve scaling, but even make Bitcoin better. Sub-cent fees. No more waiting for confirmations.

But again, this makes the whole system more complex, much more than SegWit in this case. The sheer size of LN whitepaper already says a lot about it's complexity. As proof, I invite you to read and fully understand the original Bitcoin whitepaper and code, then SegWit BIPs and code, then LN whitepaper and code. If you understand Bitcoin along with it's technical and economical implications, you are smart. If you can say the same about Bitcoin with SW, you are very smart. But you fully grasp LN along with it's technical details and economic impact on users, miners, businesses and economy, I humbly raise my hat to you because you are a member of a very exclusive club. But even if you do, I guarantee that there are some details, some implications, some edge cases that you missed in this whole BTC+SW+LN system. Not because you would be dumb, but because it's impossible to understand everything in such a complex system.

More complexity is good for TPTB. It means there are many more potential approaches, and it means fewer people will understand your motives. Once they find a potential vector to seaze control and siphon some value out of the system, they can start working on a narrative that makes their proposed change seem like a good idea to people who don't fully grasp the details of this change. The less people understand their true motives, the easier it is to shut this minority up, either by bribing, by smear campaigns, or other means. If successful, the vast majority will be on their side, and any doubters will easily be labeled as a toxic minority that is trying to harm Bitcoin, spread FUD, or just don't know what they are talking about.

What I'm saying with this (way too long) intro is that the more complex the system, the more ways there are to push changes, while making it seem that these changes are benefitial to the system. Because of this, there isn't one definitive way to take the BTC backing away from Bitcoin. If there was, people would see through it and it would never work. Possibly, most of the ways haven't even been thought up yet. I will outline one or two hypothetical scenarions, but because of reasons mentioned, I'm not saying this will be the way. My scenarios might have some flaws in it, but even if they don't, it's more likely that the approach to remove or dillute LN/BTC backing would be somewhat or completely different."

2018-06-03,"How do you incentivize a robust, secure and decentralize public chain without a crypto currency token that rewards miners?

2018-06-03,"Nothing is settled ""in the lightning network"". Every transaction over the lightning network is made with a transaction for the underlying blockchain which is valid, and pre-signed by other other party.

Enabling LN to do atomic swaps with another cryptocurrency like litecoin does not tie the value of that other currency to Bitcoin either. It merely creates a market where people can trade Bitcoin to litecoin without requiring a trused intermediary. The price of litecoin will still be decided by a market which depends purely on the usefulness of litecoin as a cryptocurrency. It's value will not depend on Bitcoin's value.

The amount of Bitcoin can't be inflated. If people trade Bitcoin for litecoin, they aren't inflating the Bitcoin supply - they are buying litecoin with Bitcoin. The amount of Bitcoin in circulation is unchanged.

I personally don't think that there is a practical use for many similar PoW based blockchains in future, but there's a practical use for atomic-swaps in being able to buy or trade other cryptographic assets without requiring third parties.

Imagine if I build a new estate of houses which I sell for dollars. Would you consider the creation of these new assets as being an inflation of the dollar?"

2018-06-03,Now you see bitcoin has a slight paradox problem
2018-06-03,"One thing you have to realize is never listen to what anyone who supports BCH says about BTC. BCH people's only goal is to con and lie and trick people into buying BCH instead of BTC. They HATE the LN because it makes BCH 100% obsolete. Up until early this year they were calling LN vaporware and said it will never come out, now that it is on the mainnet and growing and offering a service that BCH could never offer they have to make up new lies about it.

BCH's whole value proposition is cheaper fees and more transaction throughput (though of course they don't mention that they are centralizing BCH in order to do this). But LN means txs that take seconds, basically unlimited tx throughput, with near-zero fees, on a more secure and trusted blockchain vs BCH taking an hour or so depending on # of confirmations, on a much less secure blockchain, that can only do about 100 tx/sec at capacity and to even do that it would be quite centralized meaning its even less secure and trustable than it is now."

Its certainly easier to use BCH; I use BCH to demo to people new to the space why its so much better than traditional money because of the low transaction fees. But that may well change with LN adoption and with my current position I don't have to feel threatened by either chain. My thesis is that one of them is going to dominate eventually and whatever I lose in one chain will be more than made up for in the other. This way I can be pragmatic and honest in the pros and cons of each. There are pros and cons of each. Personally, I think LN is a necessary next step - eventually, for either chain - what I don't know is if it will catch on in time to keep Bitcoin as useful as Bitcoin Cash. Likewise if LN does get adoption I don't know if Bitcoin Cash will be able to catch up even if it does implement it."

2018-06-03,"&gt; LN isn't the only solution to privacy, but it's one which could be a significant improvement over plain old on-chain transactions.

While LN reduces the exposure if your transaction information, the privacy it can effectively achieve is questionable. [Onion routing as applied to LN's constrained overlay network leaves your privacy largely in the hands of untrusted, unmonitored intermediaries](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7rrjp3/is_onion_routing_appropriate_for_lightning_network/). While on-chain transactions are public in nature, the users remain in full control of the factors that influence their pseudoanonymity and there is information symmetry - you are aware of what everyone else _could_ know. LN offers the _potential_ for greater transactional privacy, but you _cannot know_ if you've actually achieved it, since it depends on the behavior of the intermediaries. If your peers are adversarial or substantially influenced by adversarial actors, you may not achieve the privacy you expect, and there is little to indicate when malicious actions have been enacted against you.

2018-06-03,"It's more that most ""crypto enthusiasts"" just want to get rich and sell their stash at high returns and have absolutely **zero** intention of utilizing or actually using the currencies they so ardently defend. It's a beautiful case-study in hypocrisy. If we really believe in crypto *we* should be on the frontlines like the early dotcom revolution in the 90s.. 

Guys were building commerce/news/porn/game sites from the very start. They were **actually using** the revolutionary technology. Not merely hoping it will make them profitable from the sidelines..

Now a lot of this has to do with the fact that much of crypto is still in it's infancy.. But there are projects with use-cases out right now.. We should be using the beta's, and giving feedback. We should be in there getting our hands dirty and not staring at a portfolio chart."

LN and Bitcoin are purely digital, secured by multisig to ensure each offchain BTC is pegged by one onchain BTC. If you can't trust the multisig there's pretty much nothing left you can trust tbh."
2018-06-03,"&gt; Well no shit LN tries to avoid transacting on the Bitcoin blockchain. That's the whole point. Nobody is in disagreement on that.

Well then go ahead and do this on BTC. Meanwhile we do BCH and we're both happy, aren't we?

&gt; Considering that you need to create an on-chain transaction to open an LN node its hard to see how the underlying blockchain would ever be side-stepped entirely. And even if you could it would still be a 1:1 relationship between the tokens on the LN and the tokens on the blockchain. 

&gt; And the fact that you think Satoshi put in traps for people is pretty telling. Ya, if you think there's conspiracy theories in the design of Bitcoin, then it makes sense that you'd think the lizard people globalists are pulling puppet strings behind the scenes to destroy Bitcoin from the inside or whatever. Makes total sense.

I simply think he was an intelligent, forward-thinking individual. Not much else I need to assume here.

&gt; We're running two experiments here. Buy some Bitcoin, buy some Bitcoin Cash. In my estimation, whatever comes, you won't be too wrong. You don't have to go all in on one of the experiments then get mad when the other makes progress.

Absolutely. I own BTC mostly because of the smallblockism, though. That's my value proposition.

LN can be sybil attacked. On-chain scaling doesn't require permission, not sure what that argument is. LN channels somehow make permissions less than on-chain? Decentralized, well that has been beaten to death so you can feel free to think on-chain scaling leads to some sort of centralization that causes problems for bitcoin to NOT be cheap/fast/reliable/permissionless/uncensorable. It does not. Satoshi clearly stated how mining farms would eventually be the main-stay for bitcoin mining. That does not equate to centralization of power.

About your point - I carry a bill, you carry a phone - we all have to carry something. I thinks sending money to a different country is not a primary concern for most people. I am definitely not saying there’s no value in bitcoin because here I am, but when people try to force use cases where alternatives works just fine I have to say something."
2018-06-03,"Well no shit LN tries to avoid transacting on the Bitcoin blockchain. That's the whole point. Nobody is in disagreement on that. What we disagree on is whether or not that's a bad thing. Considering that you need to create an on-chain transaction to open an LN node its hard to see how the underlying blockchain would ever be side-stepped entirely. And even if you could it would still be a 1:1 relationship between the tokens on the LN and the tokens on the blockchain. 


And the fact that you think Satoshi put in traps for people is pretty telling. Ya, if you think there's conspiracy theories in the design of Bitcoin, then it makes sense that you'd think the lizard people globalists are pulling puppet strings behind the scenes to destroy Bitcoin from the inside or whatever. Makes total sense.


We're running two experiments here. Buy some Bitcoin, buy some Bitcoin Cash. In my estimation, whatever comes, you won't be too wrong. You don't have to go all in on one of the experiments then get mad when the other makes progress."
2018-06-03,"Actually it's your logic that doesn't make sense. Because now under your logic no one would ever spend or sell their Bitcoin. If you never use it in any way, it's worthless because you never use its value.

Like I said: ""but that's no different than selling back to fiat at a given time"". At some point everyone will choose to use their Bitcoin, otherwise why did they buy it?! You either pick a time to sell it, but why do that when you can just spend it instead. They are the same thing, except in the latter case you are supporting bitcoin's adoption by actually using it."

2018-06-03,"&gt;no it doesn't [http://www.blocktivity.info/](http://www.blocktivity.info/)  


That chart includes Steemit, which is not a decentralized blockchain. Steemit's transaction count is high is being used in place of a traditional web server. It is not doing anything revolutionary, because no one trusts it to be immutable. They trust it as much as they would trust any centralized web server.

That's why its transactions are limited mostly to those people don't place a high value on, like up/down\-votes, and why its market cap is insignificant.

The fact that you support 1\-MB\-BTC's suffocating limits on scale, in the name of decentralization, while supporting a DPOS blockchain with \[two dozen trusted trusted third party validators\]\([https://status.steemnodes.com/](https://status.steemnodes.com/)\) processing giant blocks for non\-validating client nodes, shows that your arguments for decentralization are not consistent or coherent, suggesting you have no genuine regard for decentralization.

Your arguments about decentralization are just another talking point as part of your agenda to mislead people about Ethereum. They are just whatever you can think up on the spot to try to deceive people into staying away from the leading cryptocurrency project, Ethereum, and being herded into unscalable 1\-MB\-gatekeeper\-BTC, or to mutable deadend projects like Steemit and EOS that depend on an easily corruptible and unreliable social consensus process.

2018-06-03,"from about 2010 up until bitcoin 0.11 everyone could send a free transaction. To qualify for a free transaction your coins had be have been dormant for X time. 

This reduced spam (spam being transactions sent at no cost that congest the network) The moment you sent a transaction you get change, the change then had to age before you could send another free transaction. So it acts like a throttle on free transactions. 

I remember reading how free transactions were possible and limited at the same time I though the idea was brilliant as it discouraged the behavior you wanted to discourage while not limiting free transactions. 

Prioritizing transactions by age and and fee achieves this. if you read up on coin-days destroyed you get an idea how you could use this to limit transactions sent at no cost that congest the network without impeding use-cases for those who would need a free transaction every so often.

days destroyed gives you a way to priorities dust over economic transaction while still allowing free dust transactions. this would encourage consolidation of dust transactions. (like you sending from yours to your wallet - would be encouraged not penalized the cost to you is time, if you don't want to wait you can pay the fee.)

2018-06-03,As Bitcoin grows by orders of magnitude the underlying chain will stay relevant and profitable; you still have to open an on-chain transaction to have an LN transaction.

Its not an IOU or a tab; those are just words to make it easier for the non-technical to understand it. If a signed transaction to the blockchain and a transaction on the blockchain are so fundamentally different in your mind then I urge you to send me a signed transaction for all of your BTC (but don't broadcast it) because that'll be a bad fake IOU in the same way that actual LN transactions work.

2018-06-03,"&gt;To be clear, no crypto on the planet survives this today without critical problems

True, the article suggests as much.

&gt;Scenario 3 deals with **stolen private keys** and the attacker gaining 51% power over the network

Or buying it off as mentioned further down, more expensive but nowhere near as expensive as buying up the necessary supply on exchanges.

&gt;Not only is this an outlandish amount of money to steal (**I've never seen exchanges holding 51% of any top 100 coin**)

Again, 51% of the **staked** supply not circulating/total supply. Also, why would you target exchanges rather than individual wallets which, at least for Nano/NEM/NEO/etc., are bigger than exchanges?

&gt;but it involves the attacker working against their own interests. 

Not necessarily. The intent of the attack could be due to more than simply profit like /u/Crypto_Nicholas stated (and the second article I linked kinda touches on that). It could also be a [""benevolent 51% attack""](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Proof_of_Stake#How_Proof_of_Stake_Addresses_Monopoly_Problems).

&gt;If you got that much of the coin supply, you would sell it off slowly. There is no doublespend attack which would be anywhere near as valuable as half the coin supply of a decent project. If they did go the doublespend route, **they would crash the value of the coins they hold**. This is called an asymmetrical attack, but not one in the attackers favor

That was also the oft-cited _""downside""_ to 51% attacks against PoW coins but then Verge happened, then BTG, then Verge again and now Zencash with hardly any significant price-related damage thanks to the oh so faithful hodlers (which is honestly not necessarily a bad thing). Also, I'm pretty sure you'd crash the price more trying to sell off 51% of the staked supply fast enough to not be locked out of exchanges/forked or something. "

Ops title is misleading and a lie. Bch transactions were never twice as expensive as btc. People paying more because they want to doesn't mean differently.

If you have a need you can pay 1000000 bch fee and it will still not make a change that 1sat/byte goes as well.

Op is trying to paint a picture that bch failed as fees are higher than btc, but again, it is not true.

Funny how before consensus conference somebody was paying extra high fee. Probably to make posts like op."

People have already pointed out a lot of the red flags. The one that should have stood out more than any other was the price they were willing to pay. For example as I type this Bitcoin is trading at $7,700 usd. The absolute most I would consider paying someone cash in person is 6500. I know exactly what the person selling them to me would be doing. I also know that offer is likely more than they are going to get because they would not be selling if they were in a low tax bracket. Red flag number two obviously was all of the distraction talk. No one comes to a larger deal and starts rattling on about personal details and if they do it's after the deal is done.

While I grant you that some fool could have paid too much to the BCH miners and pushed the average fee up when they didn't need to, how dumb must you be to believe that this doesn't happen on Bitcoin as well? Hell, we have wallets like Blockchain and merchant services like Bitpay that force users to pay a far, far larger fee than is necessary per btc payment, so if any average fee is unneccearily too large, it is Bitcoin's, by far.

&gt; I will say, it's a bit funny to me that you use ETH and other alts to gain on BTC. I use BTC to gain on ETH and a select few alts. Interesting.

How does that work? You hedge into Bitcoin, if we're falling? Why wouldn't you just switch into fiat? Ethereum outperforms Bitcoin, whenever Bitcoin moves up, due to Altcoin behavior of Ethereum. It's pegged. Like, if both are having good days, on most occasions Ethereum will outperform, so I'm not sure how your strategie would even work.

"
2018-06-03,"&gt;	Well I fail to see how eltoo prevent the problem of old states broadcasting, can you eli5

This is from here: https://blockstream.com/2018/04/30/eltoo-next-lightning.html

&gt;	In eltoo every state is represented as a set of two transactions: an update transaction that spends the contract’s output and creates a new output, and a settlement transaction that spends the newly created update output and splits the funds according to the agreed-upon distribution. The outputs have a script that allows a new update transaction to be attached immediately or else a settlement transaction to be attached after a configurable timeout. Should the participants agree on an update before the timeout expires, they will create a new update transaction, spending the previous output and doublespending the corresponding settlement, effectively invalidating it.

&gt;	Not really no, the bitcoin core assumptions is miner can’t be trusted with the mempool, that’s the whole idea behind RBF.

No, it’s that perfect mempool sync is impossible, and that occassional race conditions may exist, and that it’s impossible to make a consensus rule around “first seen”, because that varies based on your location in the network.  It’s also because the default state of a successful and valuable network is going to be full blocks, and without RBF and with miners rejecting double spends you end up in a position where you have to wait for some unknown amount of time(mempool expiration is also not a consensus rule for obvious reasons) to spend your input(s) if fees happen to increase after you publish your transaction.  Effectively locking those inputs for an indeterminate amount of time.  This leads to unpredictable network behavior from a user perspective.

I’d also like to point out that the current BCH behavior around 0-conf is entirely enforced by miner altruism, and is not based in consensus.  That’s dangerous when relied upon as a guarantee.  It would be like if the current 12.5BTC block reward was not a consensus rule, and that if a miner created a block with a 25BTC coinbase that all other nodes would just accept it instead of rejecting it immediately. No node will reject a block with a transaction confirmed in it that isn’t “first seen” as the node understands it.  It will just evict the “first seen” transaction from its mempool and keep chugging along.

Also, RBF is opt-in, so you can accomplish the same thing on BTC by simply not setting the flag on your transaction.

&gt;	And now they make the security of LN relying on them to flag block or choose the proper tx in case flood attack..

Can you elaborate on this?  Flag block?  Choosing the proper transaction?

&gt;	This is a 180 degree turn around.
(Remember 0conf are supposed to be unsecure for that very reason)

I’m not sure that I follow you here.

&gt;	This was after the fact.

No, mine and everyone else’s 2X nodes just stopped at block 494782.  That should have been caught in peer review, but it wasn’t.  That was a wakeup call to me that a lot of the alternate implementations just don’t have the right brainpower behind them.  I ran BU as well, and there were multiple vulnerabilities there that allowed an external attacker to crash my node, more than once.  Everyone makes mistakes, but the stakes are just too high now for that sort of amateurism.  I trust Core to release quality code, even if I may not agree with their timeline for a hard forked block size increase.  I expect it to happen, but I also expect other technical debt to be cleaned up at the same time (See here: https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Hardfork_Wishlist).  If it takes too long, they may lose my support again as it is not unconditional. 

&gt;	Do you realize that exactly what happened for B2X (and classic and XT before?)

Classic, XT, and BU never gained majority support. 2X actually did(at least with hashrate) and fucked it up with incompetence that I detailed above. "

You just made my point for me.

A REAL cryptocurrency like Bitcoin Cash settles on-chain NOW. Not at some undetermined time in the future. Therefore, it cannot be tampered with nor turned into a fiat system.

Great quote from the Reddit thread linked to in this post:

""On to REAL cryptocurrencies, and what distinguishes them from the hijacked version of Bitcoin, and what therefore makes them such a threat to that system, as well as the old currently imploding mainstream economic system, is precisely the fact that the transactional and settlement layers are not divorced. They are exactly the same thing. You cannot tamper with any part of the system, it is a steel cable from one participant in the economy to another, with each participant being able to cryptographically verify the characteristics of the transactions which they undertake, and observe that the supply is not being tampered with in real time on a globally distributed constantly available ledger, which in turn is not subject to interference from any of the traditional forces of monetary parasitism encompassed by central banks and nation states.""

Then it's turned into this whole Moon/Lambo meme, that's basically what's driven the entire Crypto market with people believing they too can hit it big by obtaining and holding a large number of coins from an early project and become millionaires in a few months or years. 

I think the hope BTC has is in the part of the BTC community that are pushing for more stores and franchises/businesses to accept Bitcoin. It's slowly but surely happening. As for it being Primitive... maybe? Not totally, it's the original, and as such it's more trusted then new tech that claims to be better versions of it with their own tricks up the sleeve.

I'm also against a system where people can't afford to open or settle channels.

I'm personally eager to see a currency which has extremely low fees, does not sacrifice the fundamental goals of everyone being able to verify ownership of funds, trustlessly, without third-parties, without the ability to spoof, double-spend or reverse transactions, and without requiring expensive equipment to achieve all this.

&gt;This makes no sense what so ever. Of course I didn't say that. Not with your definition of a full node, or with mine.

This is literally the first sentence in your post above:

&gt;My point is never that nonmining clients checking the contents of the blocks won't stick to their consensus rules. Of course they will.

&amp;nbsp;


It's funny because an outside reader will quickly realize that you are not really addressing my points, my technical criticism to your claims. All you do is say 

""*No, that's not true. La la la la.*""

This is not arguing, this is propaganda. Distracting the conversation and ""attacking"" some perceived imperfection in the argument. To control the flow of the conversation. Roger is a master at that, his ""*Moar babies are dying*"" is a perfect example of this. Unluckily for you, I've seen this in action way too many times to fall for it, so I'm bringing you back straight to the point... the role of full, non-mining nodes.

&amp;nbsp;

It's pretty clear that you are stuck at the White Paper level of understanding of Bitcoin. This

&gt;They don't mine, so they don't vote and they don't have as much given economic incentive to do work of various sorts to support the system.

is pretty clearly based on the ""1 CPU = 1 vote"" concept. This is no different than accepting, say, quantum mechanics as valid and remain at the level of Schroedinger's papers in 1929. As the world moves on, new insights come to light. Our understanding deepens and progresses. This also applies to Bitcoin.

&gt;They can still exist and you may still run one, but they are not strictly necessary to retain security and reliabilty.

This again proves my point above. The question is not if they are *necessary*, the real question, and one that you repeatedly fail to address, is what is the effect of all these non-mining nodes on the network? Maybe they're not *necessary*, but they're there, they exist. (And not going away...) How does this affect the system? Does it change the network or not? If your answer is ""No, full nodes don't change or affect the network"", then your understanding of the **current** Bitcoin network is seriously deficient. (This is, for instance, what Rick Falkvinge claims. He's patently wrong.)

Full nodes, non-mining ones, absolutely change the network. I've explained above how. Refusal to accept that, or failure to see it, will lead to all sorts of mental gymnastics when facing questions like ""*Why did S2X/NYA fail?*"" I've seen many attempts, from ""*People just change their mind*"" to ""*Miners are pussies*"". I'm sure you have your own explanation. Basically there's one explanation for every proponent that full nodes don't matter.

The answer is, however, straightforward once you see the role of full nodes as I explained it above.




"
2018-06-03,"First of all, the slippery slope isn't necessarily a fallacy. As a valid argument, it appeals to an independent weighting of the severity of this slipperiness by the those addressed with this argument. Not everything is black and white.

And with ""LN on top of many chains"", the slope looks pretty steep already.

And, further,  it isn't like u/cryptorebel's criticism is the only thing problematic about LN.

The most important aspect, IMO, is its *design goal* to reduce the fee income for miners. Fee income for miners makes this whole thing possible!

If that isn't a pretty direct threat of the gold\-standard\-abolishment sort to Bitcoin in your eyes, then I don't know what is. And you don't need to argue with any slippery slopes on this one, either."

2018-06-03,"And by the way, most of the work comes from this article: https://www.btc-echo.de/datenschutz-grundverordnung-was-bedeutet-das-fuer-bitcoin-ethereum-co/

2018-06-03,LN tokens are a derivative of BTC. Hence I expect LN tokens to be valued at different prices in the mid- to longterm.
2018-06-03,"You need to look past the emotional banter. Underneath it all is a reality. 

If this statement triggers you you have a lot more reading to do. 

Bitcoin BCH is as much Bitcoin as Bitcoin BTC, ether one can dominate with the most accumulated hashrate in time. "
2018-06-03,"In 2010, Bitcoin once produced 184 million Bitcoins. The problem was quickly fixed by Satoshi, Garzik and others assisted. New tech will always have issues. "
2018-06-03,"So you can make a BTC transaction with a fee of 1sat/byte go into the next block reliably? And what about when the 1mb limit is reached and mempool fills? We all know how that goes. Bitcoin Core artificially manufactured the problem by not lifting the 1mb limit, and purports LN to be the scaling solution. So yes, I think LN it is clear that LN is an integral component of Bitcoin Core, in the minds of Bitcoin Core advocates. Cointext is a third party service using Bitcoin Cash as the protocol layer. Very different. No one is forced to use Cointext to be able to send cheap/fast/reliable transactions with Bitcoin Cash."
2018-06-03,"Another person who doesn't understand that people in here are NOT against LN per se.

They are against a system that is only usable by people who can afford to settle on-chain for $1000 (*fee market as envisioned by Greg and Adam) or more. Which will be banks (or hubs in LN terms).

On another note I'm all pro BTC limiting its full potential. As real P2P crypto currencies and their holders get rewarded two fold."

Adam had explained to him that the problems with Bitcoin and how it would never work because of scarcity. Adam Back was claiming that there needed to be a means of growing the amount of Bitcoin if needed.

&gt; “Well that’s what they seek to add… The concept of side chains is about infinite inflation” states Wright.

&gt; “Instead of scaling based on a scarce resource, they seek to return to the classic idea of Fiat money. Each side-chain becomes an infinitely scalable resource. If you need more money, print more with a side-chain.”

2018-06-03,"&gt; Payment channels demonstrate that it is not strictly necessary to have everything on-chain, without losing the soundness property.

Again, I would agree as long as you do not lose it. But in LN you do, even without the more long term risks I brought up in my recent post.


&gt;The question is whether payment channels can scale over a network, as proposed by LN, to allow people to transact not only with a direct party they've agreed with, but with someone else via that party.

I don't think there's any doubt that ""it"" can scale. But the question is if we really want that ""it"" or if it's a regular onchain Bitcoin transaction that we want.

&gt;(I'm a fan of Monero too).

Yeah I'm big Monero fan too. Not of their ASICs approach, but largely otherwise.

&gt;I just don't see these interesting proposals coming from this side. I see promises of vaporware from fauxtoshi.

They are not generally focused on currently, because the main thing now is to prove that we can scale _at all_ which so many distrust even without bringing fake Satoshis into the mix.

I think that for most, becoming your own bank is too much of a burden. Of course, you will probably say: ""Banks aren't accountable for your money over a certain amount"", which is true, but at least they will cover some losses in the event that you are scammed. Furthermore, crypto and blockchain offer and illusion of security that can be exploited even more so with cash or credit, in the sense of ""bad actors"".

And, finally, I do question myself.  All the time.  But I also can't learn about others if I don't ask them questions.  Which is why I've asked questions here.  You asked questions, I answered.  Then I asked questions.  But you haven't answered.

That, ""Bitcoin hits 20,000!"" Headline made too much news, and so it has been censored a bit this year, to keep *every*one from ""fomo'ing"" in. 

So the counter move is to ""FUD"" everyone away, and bag up as much loose coins as possible before the next wave breaks, and possibly washes over their levee this time.

2018-06-03,This sub is more open to debate and interested in Bitcoin as an actual method of currency as opposed to an unusable store of value. At least that’s why I’m here. Satoshi’s vision and white paper matters to a lot of people because of the potential and end goal that got many of us excited and interested in crypto currencies. Is it set in stone? Is it never to be expanded on or changed? Obviously not. But completely neglecting the ideas that bitcoin was founded upon is futile at this time.

If our channel C-D was normally backed and becomes unbalanced then we have to wait or rebalance but if we pretend fund the channel we have a lot of liquidity to play with and get more fees.

Even if C-D never routes *any* txs we still created phantom liquidity by moving product back and forth that would have required actual money.

&gt; Your users have agreed ahead of time to hard-forks as a proposition for opting into the currency. It is not fair to compare this against Bitcoin, where users had no such expectations when they got into it.

What are you talking about? Users on both BTC and BCH are mostly noob speculators or whale traders, with no expectation except that it **work**, and that hopefully the price will go up. If mainstream adoption is the ultimate goal, than 99% of people should not be expected to know or do anything.

&gt; Short-term thinking. People in BTC are well aware of the fee problems

# NO THEY ARE NOT

Again, most investors are complete noobs. I saw first hand last December the thousands of posts/comments/etc from all kinds of users. ""WTF? Why coinbase charge $50 to withdraw coins!!"" Ask Steve Pair of Bitpay if most people were aware. And it doesn't help when the front page of bitcoin.org says [low fees and fast transactions](https://bitcoin.org), which they finally decided to briefly take down, or that places like r/ bitcoin completely remove and censor genuine critical discussion. [link](https://np.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/6rxw7k/informative_btc_vs_bch_articles/dl8v4lp/?st=jaotbt8m&amp;sh=222ce783)

&gt; The POV of Bitcoiners is that extremely large blocks can only lead to an increase in the centralization of mining and validation of their coins, which is another loss of confidence in that store of value proposition

The store of value proposition is **complete bogus**. [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjRoQYsVIY4). Once again, if it does not have a primary use first, it is **not a store of value**. Bitcoin is a horrible store of value. That's why we have coins like tether. Everything you see is **speculation**.

&gt; because if mining becomes overly centralized

[link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vM_Ski2eK6A&amp;feature=youtu.be)

Additionally, centralization is far worse on LN. You have to trust third party watch towers if you can't run a node all the time, which 99.99% of people will be unwilling and unable to do. You won't be able to afford on chain transactions to move your coins to your own wallet. Any small time miners will be unable to afford to move their mining rewards, insuring only the largest of miners mine. And in order to provide liquidity, massive LN hubs will inevitably result. LN will be one of the most centralized payment systems ever devised if implemented how they are trying. But even if somehow all of these problems were overcome...

&gt; We'll deal with those problems then.

The problems are already here, right **now**. Bitcoin has had a scaling problem for **years**. LN is not even close to being ready. There is not even a route-finding solution that will scale to a million users. Watchtowers have not been figured out. It is completely impractical. LN not only needs to work, it needs to be more **attractive** to the average user than literally any other coin, or even a credit card, and it needs to be 100% safe.

&gt; For now, people are confident that their money isn't going to depreciate because of rash decisions

😂. Even if that were true, they're still not confident in BTC, otherwise you wouldn't see a 60% sell off over the course of a few months. 😂

&gt; to alleviate a short-term problem

There is no short term problem in increasing the blocksize to 32 mbs. Today's hardware could **easily** handle blocks of several hundred megabytes. Bitcoin's original blocksize was 32 mbs, and that was almost 10 years ago. 1mb is a laughing stock. Other coins are gladly sailing by while the BTC clownshow tinkers with their experiments. The potential problem is already here, and even if LN is the solution, it's years away, if ever.

&gt; BCH may be adopted more by people who have nothing to store, and just want to use it purely for transacting

You finally get it!

&gt; But then its less clear what advantage BCH really offers over plain-old cash.

Because having the ability to transact with anyone in the world instantly and for near free **is itself an extremely valuable service**. And again, if it does this successfully, it will **also become a store of value**."
2018-06-03,"But if you don't need to see other people's transactions (because they're private), then what is the purpose of propagating and storing them over a global distributed ledger?

The purpose was always as I alluded to in the previous post: it is to know whether or not somebody has the ownership of capital (by holding the private keys), which give them the capacity to spend. As long as you know this, then the means of actually making this happen don't strictly matter. If you can do it cheaply (by not storing it), then I'd consider that superior.

That doesn't mean LN is the one and only technology to do this. There may be other approaches that are superior and are less complex than LN. But we seem to be missing the wood for the trees. The purpose of the blockchain isn't to store and propagate every transaction - it's to provide a means of proving ownership of capital through public key cryptography without third-parties, whilst removing the ability to forge or double-spend. Storing and propagating every transaction is how this was initially realized - but people seem to be missing the point as to *why* that was done.

If Bitcoin Cash can come up with a solution to privacy, a solution to unlimited expansion (allowing me to continue to transact without third-parties), then you might convince me to switch, but I'm not seeing it. All I see is people pushing the idea of putting everything on the chain and growing indefinitely."

I don't hold BTC or BCH. I just see the same repetitious arguments repeated by BTC maximalists that go unchecked. ""Deceipt"" I think you meant ""deceit"". There is no deceit, the people who believe BCH is more true to the original Bitcoin whitepaper have a point. The people who are against BCH just scream and cry foul."
2018-06-03,"Bitcoin(Cash) is a system where every transaction is public knowledge. Nobody has transactional privacy (unless they pay for it), and every transaction incurs a transmission and storage charge from third-parties (miners).

This system has usefulness. It allows people to verify whether people have the capacity to perform transactions by knowing whether or not they have the private keys which match public keys that funds were originally sent to.

None of these properties are lost with LN. A party involved in a channel knows whether or not the other party has the capacity to perform the transaction, because he discovered upon opening a channel that the other party has the funds and cannot spend them whilst the channel is open. He can continually monitor (privately) that the other party has funds to make transactions over the channel, because the balance is agreed and signed each time.

It is not your business how much my wage is, who I even work for, or how often I buy coffee (and also where I was at what time), etc. Storing and propagating everyone's transactions is extremely dangerous to privacy and personal security, and without some kind of build in fungibility, Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash suffer these problems. LN isn't the only solution to privacy, but it's one which could be a significant improvement over plain old on-chain transactions.

I compared it to opening a bank, but it's not the same as opening a bank. There is no custodial transfer of funds, there is no state-controlled regulation which could lock you out of your funds. Reputation does not matter with LN because it is settled purely by mathematics and cryptography. The only ""insurance"" you need is a node receiving transactions on the Bitcoin network, or a watchtower to do it on your behalf."

2018-06-03,"I have no idea who you work for. You just happen to be using the same tactics as government agents.

Your argument of adding new people to the network has absolutely nothing to do with LN becoming a fiat currency network, [which it is absolutely designed to become](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7fsbw5/divorcing_the_settlement_and_transaction_layers/).

2018-06-03,"People don't have to understand exactly about how bitcoin works, the same as people don't understand how emails or the internet work or computers work, or cars or basically anything remotely technical. It has to be easy to use. It might be too complex for SOME people now, but so was almost any new technology.

Another question I have for you. You are wasting almost every day on r/bitcoin concerntrolling. What exactly is your agenda? We both know you are dishonest in what you write and how you mean it. I'm not here every day, but when I am I see some concerntrolling or straightup lies from you all the time. I don't visit r/btc to tell them how shitty and useless bcash is, I also don't visit r/football every day and tell them football sucks and it should be called handegg instead. Why do you feel you have to tell people every day how bad bitcoin is and that it's definitely not going to work?"
2018-06-03,"Disregarding the false equivalence, what something costs does not equal what people have paid. Consider this:

A local grocery store has an item for $8.99, but only keeps a few in stock. A local convenience store has the same item for $6.49 and commonly keeps many in stock. Neither location has excess supply or excess demand.

If you worked at the grocery, how much would you say the item costs?

If you worked at the convenience store, how much would you say the item costs?

If you are a shopper that does not work at either location, how much would you say the item costs?

People sometimes pay 30 s/b. It does not cost 30 s/b, it costs 1 s/b for both chains \(although BTC sometimes sees increases during periods of high congestion that could cause transactions to be dropped by miners\).

It is also worth noting that fees for BTC are not measured in s/b, they are measured in s/w \(segregated signatures are weighted differently than transaction data, so it is measured in byte\-weights\) so this is a difficult comparison."
2018-06-03,Tamperproof ledger and the system designed to secure it. Is this the basic stuff of Bitcoin? ;)
2018-06-03,"&gt;The transactions which matter are the ones where the users open and close a ledger, in which case the starting balance of the ledger is broadcast on the blockchain, and also the closing balances to each party are broadcast.

&gt;The idea is to keep them open for as long as they are useful. You could consider it like opening a bank account, or taking out a store card, or any general account in business sense. People do this all the time, and they transfer bank accounts all the time, or switch suppliers depending on which serves their interest best.

&gt;Also, nodes can disappear, have frequent network outages, or any plrethora of reasons which would cause people to close channels and reopen them with more reliable nodes.

And you don't see any problems with these statements? Those are my primary painpoints with the Lightning Network. It simply is not comparable to Bitcoin. 

If I want to use something like that, I won't opt for LN but for an insured bank with good reputation and customer service. Liquidity will be abundant in all directions and I won't have to care about anything technical. "
2018-06-03,"It is not unethical. What they are going to do is work with an outside agency or internally vet/review ads to see if they are scams. Look what they did with Alcohol and Drug treatment facilities. They banned advertising of them because people were essentially running scams and preying on people advertising ""Treatment Facilities"" that were really just someone's house and they would have drug dealers stop in, not properly care for patients, etc. If you look they have hired an outside agency to vet these treatment facilities and then Google will allow them to advertise again. 


It actually makes a lot of sense and I agree with the decision. So many people potentially could be ripped off by some scammer via Google AdWords who are new to crypto. That would be a bad thing and would prevent the forward momentum of crypto in the mainstream. "

I’d agree they’re not hitting that goal today with 50kb blocks, but it’s been less than a year, do you think BCH use will never pick up as long as it remains the cheapest network to use? I don’t see it failing longterm from never getting used, i see it failing from running into more on chain scaling challenges than anticipated, personally.

 As for the free money bit, it’s initial value didn’t come “for free”, it came at the expense of BTC. Since then, the outlet for all the pressure of community infighting getting a release seemed to create a lot more value in each project,  i’d estimate."

I don't think its a bad strategy to sell 10% of your remaining holdings either, every time it goes up x10 or whichever multiplier you choose.

&gt; **Paul Wasensteiner ‏@PWasensteiner**

&gt; 1. Those that have tried to 'fix' #Bitcoin by changing it to something else entirely have done so because they do not understand the *invisible hand*. They feel it should be their hand there instead.

&gt; 2. This is why we have BTC thought leaders telling people that 'their node gives them power over the network' and that 'miners are evil'. They simply do not understand the incentives of the system i.e. the invisible hand.

&gt; 3. Network participants are all incentivised to *naturally* do what benefits themselves and the system. I.e. #Bitcoin aligns the incentives of the system with the participant.

&gt; 4. The strength of the alignment is a function of the amount of skin the game.

&gt; 5. Miners have an amount of skin in the game ∝ (proportional) to their fixed cost investment.  
Businesses that have integrated Bitcoin have skin in the game, ∝ to their reliance on it.   
Individuals that hold bitcoin have skin in the game ∝ to their holdings.

&gt; 6. Exchanges have skin in the game ∝ the amount of income they derive from trading pairs of that specific cryptocurrency.

&gt; 7. Non-mining nodes have no skin in the game. You can spin up 10,000 nodes right now and say you are the majority of the nodes in the network. A node does not require you to hold any Bitcoin.

&gt; 8. Developers do not *necessarily* have any skin in the game. In fact, their motives and interests are often entirely unclear.

&gt; 9. Should *all* miners decide to fork:   
Exchanges can decide they will not list the fork, businesses can decide to stop using it, investors can sell it (before the fork), a non-mining node can do nothing. I.e. all you can do is remove your skin from the game to hurt miner profits.

&gt; 10. Should *some* miner decide to fork:  
Exchanges decide how they want to list each side of fork. Businesses can decide to use one fork or the other. A non-mining node can upgrade or do nothing but has no effect on outcome. I.e. participants can place skin on each side of fork.

&gt; 11. What does this all mean? Well, it is actually quite profound. #Bitcoin creates an invisible hand that aligns participant's self-interest with the network proportional to their skin in the game and incentivises people to put more skin in the game.

&gt; 12. What this means is, that adoption and decentralisation are inextricably linked. The more adoption there is, the more people have skin in the game and the more decentralisation there is.

&gt; 13.  In a world of hyperbitcoinization, when every lawyer, judge, politician, business person, engineer, designer, builder, business, government, organisation, community, have skin in the game, every person on the planet will be aligned to securing and improving the network."

O_o

Anyone that was involved in Bitcoin 2009-2013 would have known that the block size limit was just a temporary anti-flooding limit and that the plan from the start was to make sure that blocks were allowed to get bigger with demand so that fees would remain low for the foreseeable future.

So my friend, **BTC** is the money that no longer functions as we expected it to when we acquired it."

2018-06-03,"&gt; Bro, Bitcoin Cash just had its successful 2nd hardfork in May. Nothing bad happened. Monero hardforks every 6 months. So do a lot of coins. They are just protocol upgrades. Satoshi specified how to do them safely and indeed they are done safely all the time.

Your users have agreed to hard-forks as the proposition for opting into the currency. It is not fair to compare this against Bitcoin.

Monero can fork frequently because its user-base is almost entirely technical competent individuals who have no trouble securing their machines and updating this software.

&gt; Like when people last June bought $100 worth of bitcoin and were able to move it for a few dollars, then moved it last December when the fees were $50 per transaction and realized it didn't function as they expected to when they acquired it?

Short-term thinking. People in BTC are well aware of the fee problems and we're all looking forward for solutions. The debate is about how to achieve those solutions. The POV of Bitcoiners is that extremely large blocks can only lead to an increase in the centralization of mining and validation of their coins, which is another loss of confidence in that store of value proposition, because if mining becomes overly centralized then miners could collude to inflate the supply.

On the other hand, there's proposals for payment channels, which don't contribute to mining centralization and don't sacrifice some of Bitcoin's fundamental properties. People look at this more optimistically, and are willing to put up with those higher fees temporarily while we find the right scaling solutions.

It may be the case that hard forks are needed in BTC, or that we can't find an off-chain scaling solution after trying. We'll deal with those problems then. For now, people are confident that their money isn't going to depreciate because of rash decisions made to alleviate a short-term problem (and creating a potential even bigger problem in the long run). BCH may be adopted more by people who have nothing to store, and just want to use it purely for transacting. But then its less clear what advantage BCH really offers over plain-old cash."

What matters is that people can have confidence long term, that their asset will not become value-less. If they can accidentally have it stolen because they've not updated their client software, they're not going to have a strong confidence of it's longevity as a value store.

2018-06-03,"I agree with this original post 100%.  Edward Snowden also said that the #1 problem within crypto is the tribalism.  Maybe it's an age thing?  Maybe it's an insecurity/lack of identity thing?  Maybe it's a matter of people investing more than they can afford to lose aka desperation thing? Maybe the volatility of crypto is mentally taxing on some and the fact that every day a different coin is up 20% on the 24H change creates jealousy?  Whatever it is, it is bad for the market, bad for adoption, and bad for our chances at having new people enter the market.  Everyone needs to grow up.  This doesn't happen in the stock market.  This doesn't happen in the housing market.  In the sports gambling world, fans and bettors from opposing sides watch the same game, side by side, in the same bars and sportsbooks.  Very bizarre.

- Early on, I noticed BTC holders throwing shade at ETH, simply bc ETH was increasing in price at a faster rate, despite the fact that one is a platform and one is a currency.

- I see VeChain holders attacking every and any coin that is a) new b) provides passive income or c) also competes in supply chain.  Yes, VEN, you were early to the masternode/supplychain/passive income party and now many others will join the scene.  Accept it, without getting defensive or negative.

- I see people trash TRX constantly, despite the fact that the price 2X'ed in the 2 weeks leading up to testnet and also 2X'ed in 5 weeks leading up to MainNet.  They have their own platform, own partners, and an Ivy-League educated CEO who believes in marketing.  I am not a TRX fan but I'm also not going to call a coin a sh&amp;% coin if it employs 100 programmers from Amazon, Alibaba, Google, and Microsoft.

- Any time a new, or next generation, platform shows up on the scene, holders of other platforms freak out and spew negativity without understanding the tech, business model, or use cases.  There is plenty of room for dozens, if not hundreds of platforms in the future.

Grow up.  You are not saving the world by investing in crypto.  You are not the devs building the tech that represents the future.  You are an investor who hopes for the best so that you can have more $ in your acct than what you started with.  If you want to save the world, donate and volunteer.  If you want to contribute to the tech of the future, learn to program and build your own DApps or apply to these blockchain companies.  Stop pretending that buying a coin on an exchange means you understand the competitive landscape and tech under the hood.  Cheer your fellow brothers and sisters on in the market.  The more projects that succeed, the more credibility the entire market receives.  It's better for all of us if projects succeed rather than failing.  No more hatred.  We are one army.  Crypto. Blockchain.  Technology.  New wave of doing everything in an outdated world.  Let's all win together and stop bashing other projects that we forgot to invest in.  Stop attacking projects that are making their holders more money than your project is making you.  Stop dissing projects that think marketing is a helpful aspect of running a business.  Stop putting down projects that have a similar product as the one you invested in.  The cream will rise to the top, thanks to the actual devs performances and CEOs roadmaps, not bc of the holders reddit posts nor TG messages.  We are fans, sitting in the seats.  We are not on the field, making plays.  Let the teams do the talking with their products, use cases, and partners.  They are the only ones on the field, making plays.  We pay the price of admission to be hooligans but some of you need to be ejected from the stadium for giving the sport a bad name."

2018-06-03,"any fee over 1sat for BCH is too much. 

1 sat of BTC cost like 7x more than 1 sat of BCH"
2018-06-03,"&gt; A loaf of bread is transacted extremely frequently, but what is it's inherent value?

It depends how much there is (scarcity), and how much the person needs it (usefulness). If you're in a concentration camp watching your child about to die from starvation, and you have a briefcase full of cash, how much would you pay for it? Likewise, if  you're stuck underwater, what price is a canister of oxygen worth to you? Value comes from **usefulness and scarcity.** It does not come from scarcity alone. A currency needs to be useful as money. It can not be a store of value alone. That quality is secondary. And before you bring up gold, know that gold is completely different than software. Software is not a rare earth element, can not be used in jewelry or electronics, can not be held in your hand, can easily be forked, etc. etc. Additionally, there are thousands of other cryptocurrencies out there. It is absurd to believe that one would be a store of value, while another, separate coin would be used as a currency. **The coin that does the latter will be the former**. This is basic economics. Bitcoin is not a currency as we saw last December. And LN is not even [ready yet](https://twitter.com/CobraBitcoin/status/988504183786569728), assuming it ever will be.

&gt; Bitcoin Cash doesn't have the same value property Bitcoin has because of the risks of hard forks... Hard forks introduce a big problem for potential double spending or theft if everyone is not up-to-date on the news and have updated all of their software to support the new forks.

Bro, Bitcoin Cash just had its successful 2nd hardfork in May. Nothing bad happened. Monero hardforks every 6 months. So do a lot of coins. **They are just protocol upgrades**. Satoshi specified how to do them safely and indeed they are done safely all the time.

&gt; People don't have the same confidence that their money will always function as they expected it to when the acquired it,

Like when people last June bought $100 worth of bitcoin and were able to move it for a few dollars, then moved it last December when the [fees were $50 per transaction](https://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/#0,1y) and realized it **didn't function as they expected to** when they acquired it?"
2018-06-03,"BCH is also used far less than BTC, to make a true comparison, simulations have to be done, using inputs of the historical data, and make the transaction levels as a percentage of block space the same. 

So, the cost when 80&amp;#37; of block space is filled, 50&amp;#37;, 30&amp;#37;, 90&amp;#37;, and so on"

2018-06-03,"Yes that’s called “how commerce works” and it happens right now today all over the world. Eg my business and company we do business with have 60 day net terms with each other. We buy from stuff from them and they from us and we settle the accounts every 2 months but in that time money moves back and forth in terms of virtual ious. And at the end of 2 months one of us writes a check for USD to settle the difference.

So now with LN replace ‘terms’ with LN and USD with bitcoin and it’s the same thing. The only difference is we can use the liquidity we invented to route other people’s payments back and forth and collect fees on our channel. 

We are actually doing this soon: this year and we are going to fund the channel with 10X the amount of bitcoin we both hold. Guess what? 10:1 leverage just like banks and we’ve effectively inflated the money supply."
2018-06-03,"This could simply be a way for them to get a list of people who are moving money with crypto between borders and not declaring. Right now Bitcoin is used to move large transfers of money that would otherwise have to be declared.

2018-06-03,Crypto is created for the citizens of the world **without** government regulations. We should be in control!
2018-06-03,"1. Shopify. That means you accept BTC through a 3rd party intermediary as Bitpay, Conbase etc.  
If I see a merchant that redirect my BTC payment to a Conbase/Bitpay page, I will cancel immediately the payment and NEVER use that merchant again, until they fix the problem (get rid of intermediaries).There are already many solution to implement in a webshop, to accept BTC without any intermediary.  
Reminder: [Satoshi's papers](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf), stated: **Abstract. A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.**    
Any intermediary between your BTC payment and the merchant is violating the definition of Bitcoin and your privacy.  
**Privacy is a right that we should all enjoy.**  

Bitpay was/is one of the main ""promoter"" of taking over the Bitcoin code using the so called SegWit2X fork, that specify clearly a filtered blockchain address (bad or good) and based on that, people get blocked or not to use BTC. This is a fundamental attack against Bitcoin.

2018-06-03,"I don’t hold any BTC or ETH because I believe other tech blockchain tech is already superior to BTC and will eventually be superior to ETH.

2018-06-03,"Scenario 1 and 2 are essentially massive network failure or segementation attacks.  To be clear, no crypto on the planet survives this today without critical problems.  Any blockchain with any proof type will fork in these scenarios.  Recovery is also somewhat similar because Proof of Stake still does have a sort of ""work score"", it's just not hashpower based.  

In reality, recovery would probably not look like ""finding the right chain"", it would look like forking into USA chain and Europe chain.  Otherwise, you're looking at rolling back X blocks, undoing transactions, and the immutability of your chain is compromised.  You've got another ETH split debate on your hands

Scenario 3 deals with stolen private keys and the attacker gaining 51% power over the network.  Not only is this an outlandish amount of money to steal (I've never seen exchanges holding 51% of any top 100 coin), but it involves the attacker working against their own interests.  If you got that much of the coin supply, you would sell it off slowly.  There is no doublespend attack which would be anywhere near as valuable as half the coin supply of a decent project.  If they did go the doublespend route, they would crash the value of the coins they hold.  This is called an asymmetrical attack, but not one in the attackers favor  "

2018-06-03,"&gt;10 crypto commandments off the top of my head

&gt;1) Markets move fast, Patience and strategy win the game. Having a buy strategy is easy. Sell strategy can be more challenging. Come up with something a little more sophisticated than HODL...because there has to be an endpoint somewhere

Damn right they move fast. And yeah, have a plan going in to the field and STICK TO IT. Only adjust plans if you are in a level headed state of mind, and any adjustments to your plan have a logical way to approach risk/reward rebalancing in a safe and healthy way.

&gt;2) if you are losing sleep over this you are overly invested.

Yup. If your investment makes you worried, you need to rebalance IMMEDIATELY. You've already put yourself in a vulnerable situation. You need to emphasize safety.

&gt;3) unless you are skilled and know what you’re doing, i recommend that you do not day-trade

Day trading is like trying to ""go pro"" in a sport after doing a month of ""pick up"" games at a local park.

&gt;4) do research, read white papers. There’s a lot of convincing propaganda especially here on Reddit. Learn to sift through the bullshit and hold conversations on substance. Seek reliable sources on your information to make thoughtful decisions. Seek to make investments in projects that you think will grow and mature in 3-5 years.

I read a new white paper 3-4 times a week. I basically grab the biggest (in terms of market cap) coin's white paper that I haven't read yet. I'm about 300 white papers in, and this has helped so much!

&gt;5) fomo is emotional, and you do not want to make emotionally charged decisions with your investments.

Yup. A level headed person almost always takes an emotional investor's money.

&gt;6) create a thoughtful, balanced and diversified portfolio that is built up overtime. 

Yup. That allocation needs to reflect your understanding and the risk involved. Anything over 10% of your total investments without robust knowledge of crypto is asking for a problem. Don't even think about investing in crypto without a maxed out Roth IRA.

Every single person who has done DCA for over a year or more does not regret doing DCA.

2018-06-03,"It matters that other people will use it too, which is why it's important for it to be distributed, but something doesn't just have value because it is widespread and transacted frequently.

A loaf of bread is transacted extremely frequently, but what is it's inherent value?

It decays with time. If you resell the bread immediately, you might get the same amount, or perhaps even more if you buy cheap and sell more expensive. If you buy bulk you can get cheaper still, and perhaps even make money.

But it's a fucking awful store of value, because it starts of a brown colour and turns green.

Bitcoin Cash doesn't have the same value property Bitcoin has because of the risks of hard forks. Hard forks introduce a big problem for potential double spending or theft if everyone is not up-to-date on the news and have updated all of their software to support the new forks. People don't have the same confidence that their money will always function as they expected it to when the acquired it, which is why Bitcoin Cash is worth less than Bitcoin, despite them having almost the same scarcity."

They don't need to be. Transactions are confidential between the parties who agreed to it. No reason to make it all public knowledge.

The transactions which matter are the ones where the users open and close a ledger, in which case the starting balance of the ledger is broadcast on the blockchain, and also the closing balances to each party are broadcast.

&gt; But the plan is to potentially never settle them

The idea is to keep them open for as long as they are useful. You could consider it like opening a bank account, or taking out a store card. People do this all the time, and they transfer bank accounts all the time, depending on which serves their interest best.

Also, nodes can disappear, have frequent network outages, or any plrethora of reasons which would cause people to close channels and reopen them with more reliable nodes."

&gt; This is ridiculous and any person who has lived under socialized heathcare would say the same.

Not an argument

&gt; My recommendation is to read some modern economic theory. Pretty much any competent academic thinks An-Capitalism is complete hogwash.

Markets work these things out, not intellectual central planners.

&gt; The reason there are an-caps in crypto is because most people in this space are here to invest and make money

Nah, look to the evangelists in the space.   That's the ancap community.  Yeah there's money to be made, but that's not the big reason they're here.  We do have our share of whales though, look to all the crypto funded non-country &amp; seasteading stuff.

again, look to the definition.  Without Rulers.   Banks are evil, no doubt and they may fund said rulers, but they're not the authoritarians of this society.  That's the guy who is wearing the costume waving the gun around the room.

As far as the banks go, I'm with Henry Ford here ""It is well enough that people of the nation do not understand our banking and monetary system, for if they did, I believe there would be a revolution before tomorrow morning."".

Then it would be either a) you had no clue and just bought the moon&amp;lambo fantasies, or b) you bought in the vision of BTC as means of exchanging value without central authorities or monetary policies. As for a) it does not make sense, because you either already sold at 6k$ for fear or just waiting for the value to go back to 15-19k, with no interest whatsoever as the coins may still be on coinbase. Now, for b) you bought the vision at 19k$, and maybe keep buying, then you might spend only to reward merchants, and to fuel the new “economy”, not because is particularly convenient for you.

One thing I noticed is that a lot of btc commissions (and merchandise and even jobs paid in bitcoin) are meta.

I want to see a point when cryptos are used to pay for commissions that were about something other than bitcoin itself, but how to get there is the question. Maybe the average person doesn't really have a *need* for cryptos yet (just like how the regular person back in the 90's didn't have a need for email when telephones and fax machines did the job).

Maybe what we can do is go around asking specific artists that we like, and ask them if they will be open to accepting bitcoins as payment for their work.

2018-06-03,"I think you misunderstood my point entirely.  Just because some city in Italy has a big BTC push does not make it ""the city of the future"" - Shenzhen is the city of the future not because of a ""currency"" but because it represents the high volume, rapid prototype to market economy that is rapidly displacing the traditional large scale manufacturing base."
2018-06-03,"Because LN is just a set of fancy smart contracts built on the BTC blockchain.  Because of this, you can always prove how much money is in a given channel by looking at the opening transaction, even if you do not know exactly what the balance between the two individuals in the channel is.  By itself, this alone provides a significant level of protection against coin-inflation through the LN.

It's also important to understand what an LN transaction is.  An LN transaction represents a BTC transaction between two parties which simply has not been broadcast to the network to be mined.  Broadcasting this transaction to the network would mean that you close out the channel.  Closing the channel amounts to spending the BTC that was tied to the opening transaction.  So it's impossible to close a *channel* with a greater total amount of BTC than it was opened with, though the balances between the two parties may have changed wildly.  This ignores things like ""topping up"" a channel to increase its balances, which more or less boils down to simultaneously closing and reopening a new channel between the same two parties.  When a new transaction occurs, the last ""channel state"" is invalidated by both participants in the channel.  I won't dive into the full details here because there are plenty of resources online for it, and most of them are not directly tied to this discussion.

So, let's say you have the following ""LN Network""

* A has a channel with B
* B has a channel with C
* C has a channel with D

For simplicity, let's say each of these channels has 10BTC, meaning 5 BTC on each side.  So the network would look like this:

    A/5-----5/B/5-----5/C/5-----5/D

Now, let's say that A wants to send 1BTC to D.  In a normal, happy network where nobody is trying to cheat or otherwise be dishonest, A sends 1BTC to B, B sends 1 to C, and finally, C sends 1 to D.  The ending state looks like this:

    A/4-----6/B/4-----6/C/4-----6/D

Note how the individual channels still stayed capped at 10 BTC.  Nothing was created or destroyed, just moved around.  Now, if B and C decided to collude to try and cheat the system.  They decide to do this by refusing to update the channel balance between them, so that ""it never runs out"" and they can keep collecting fees.

    A/4-----6/B/5-----5/C/4-----6/D

Again, we see that this does not create or destroy any BTC.  Each individual channel it still at 10 total BTC and A and D still have their correct balances.  I should note that it's impossible for only half the payment to go through, such as B accepting the payment from A but D never receiving it because C refused to surrender it.  Either the entire multi-hop payment completes or none of it does.

This all works because the BTC tied up in the AB channel is different from the BTC used to tie up the BC channel, which is different yet again from the CD channel's BTC.  Each channel was secured by its own, publically available and verifiable transaction on the BTC blockchain.  Even if B and C decided that they wanted their channel to ""have 50 BTC"" instead of just 10, they cannot ever get away with it because the entire BTC, and LN, network knows that the channel cannot total beyond 10 BTC - and they cannot give any of this fake BTC away to A or D because those channels are funded with different BTC in a different transaction, and both A and D know what the state of their respective channels are supposed to be.

Hopefully this demonstrates some of the robustness of the LN, and why it's just as secure as the blockchain that it is based upon.  It cannot be compromised without also compromising the underlying BTC blockchain.  Lastly, because a channel's balance is verifiable directly on the base layer, even if it's more difficult to determine the actual balance between two parties (privacy!?), you can rest assured that any and all LN transactions are done with real BTC, backed by the real PoW and security of the network, without any funny business.  Importantly, you can do this even as a BTC user who never actually joins the LN and just transacts purely on-chain."

An increased blocksize limit for BTC with a corresponding increase in transaction capacity could be disastrous to BCH, because some people might think BCH has no purpose if BTC isn't artificially constrained anymore. So why would miners ever agree to this? If they agree to hard fork BTC, they'd do so *against their self-interest in BCH*, unless they assume that the BTC+BCH value is higher after the fork than before. As BCH increases in value relative to BTC, this becomes less likely. How low should the BCH/BTC ratio be for rational miners to consider sacrificing BCH on the altar of increased BTC capacity? 0.2? 0.1? How low does the ratio need to be for there to be consensus among BTC miners so that there is no risk of a BTC chain split? 0.05?

How cute. A great way to convince people who disagree you by calling them ""lunatics"" and ""stupid"".  Guess why BCH fans are generally disliked in the crypto community outside the /r/btc subreddit?

&gt; read the bitcoin whitepaper, that's the roadmap for BCH. it's decentralization and yes it involved miners competing, just as bitcoin was designed to do.

Intentionally or not, BCH is on a way to destroying the system of counterweights by giving too much power to miners. BCH promoters are trying to convince everyone that it's okay even if average users eventually become unable to run full nodes due to high costs, claiming that the average users are just ""spectators"". And this the primary reason why I don't support BCH.

I mentioned Ripple because it is a centralized system where a single company controls emission of their tokens and they are not hiding this. Nevertheless some people are supporting Ripple and it has a significant market cap.

The same can be said about fiat money. Some people genuinely think that the government controlling money emission is a good idea.

2018-06-03,"I think its very rude to come into this sub and try to petition that a fork with untested technology and very very shady ""CEOs"" etc running it would be ""bitcoin"". 

Bitcoin is what Satoshi Nakamoto stipulated in his whitepaper ""Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System"". The only version of that vision is Bitcoin (BCH). "
2018-06-03,"Lol you’re still trusting them...

And they can always collude and pay off people not to report it.  They’re motivated by greed right?

Also the price is dictated by the market.  The market is irrational.  People are still buying bitcoin gold and it’s still listed.  

Imo it has to do with mass adoption which unfortunately means people will be less educated as to why a Blockchain has value.

2018-06-03,"&gt; I don't care how many people see it in any specific way, but I would point out that your conclusion doesn't necessary follow at all. BTC has incumbency and is thus ""the default option"". The fact that significant amounts of traffic has not yet moved over to the re-implementation is not a statement that the new roadmap is superior, it's a statement that incumbency is a huge advantage. 

I don't deny that there's momentum in network effect. 

&gt;To say otherwise would be to assume if it was the original roadmap on the BTC ticker, we'd be doing a lot worse, and there's zero evidence for that hypothesis at all.

So you think ad populum arguments are fallacious but appeal to authority is fine by you? Lol.

&gt;At any rate, as I said, what people think is simply irrelevant to what the truth actually is. The world is packed with complete morons that don't know the most basic facts about reality, what they think is about as relevant as last week's hockey scores.

Agreed, but don't forget that smart money also is in Bitcoin, not BCash.

"
2018-06-03,"&gt; A CPU is needed to run a NODE. That's what he expected to get a vote. 

Then why does Bitcoin explicitly incentivize running miners via the block reward, whilst it offers asbolutely no incentive for people to run non-mining nodes?

Remember, there was no distinction between mining nodes and non-mining nodes. In the whitepaper \*all\* nodes were mining nodes. The entire concept of a non-mining node is an aberration that didn't exist until long after satoshi went dark.

Also it's clear that Satoshi *did* envision ASIC's, and to a certain extent mining centralization.

&gt; The current system where every user is a network node is not the intended configuration for large scale ... The more burden it is to run a node, the fewer nodes there will be.  Those few nodes will be big server farms.  The rest will be client nodes that only do transactions and don't generate.

Yes we'd all like mining to be more competitive and less centralized. But blaming asics and pretending non-mining nodes matter is not that way to do that."

Commerce there moves lighting fast, with development cycles that are counted in days or weeks instead of months or years.  Bang out a prototype on your laptop in a cafe, send the gerbers to a local board house and the CAD files to any of countless machine shops or 3D printing businesses running in converted market stalls or shops.

2018-06-03,"The question really is, what gives the LN token its value? Is it really only the value of BTC_? If everyone moves to LN, and never settles on the BTC chain, since there is no longer a point to, the underlying BTC network becomes irrelevant. BTC's price goes to zero, but do the LN token values also go to zero once nobody is using BTC? That is the point. They are trying to take the MOE value of BTC and put it into LN so that BTC becomes irrelevant and decouples from the price of BTC. Eventually we will have LN backed by nothing just like we have fiat backed by nothing.

The purpose of this entire scaling debate was to destroy the value of BTC itself, which is the POW security. In time, POW will be replaced by POS as LN. The writing is on the walls.

2018-06-03,"Point 1: I was suggesting using a bitcoin wallet as a bank that you have control over as a user on a decentralized and now fairly mature technology (10 years old) - and transitioning into this dynamic. So yeah exactly what you said the whole point is decentralized... could have made that clearer.

Point 2: No - the whole point of fractional reserve lending is that a bank can lend 8 to 12 times the amount of money it has on deposit reserve (backed by its cash deposits) and the bullshit that is the federal reserve printing (electronically now) money out of thin air (gold standard left the system in the 70s). The bank is able to write 8 loans (paper asset) in proportion to the deposit and then cash them into the fed for enough cash to replace the deposits on file for a small interest payment on only that one amount. That is what is meant by fraction of a reserve...the reserve is a ""fraction"" of what it backs. The bank then charges the borrower interest on 8 loans and pays the interest on the one backing deposit loan (thus pocketing 7 of those and paying with one). The whole system is a house of cards designed to print money out of thin air. If all the loans were actually called at once the system would collapse and the USD go to zero. However, I will agree that this wont happen any time soon. Good cryptocurrencies are backed by the mining hash or proof of stake in such a decentralized way (everyone can independently validate it and does not have to take the word of the currency issuer) that if any one country went under the currency would still survive - and that mining hash protects the integrity of the network - UNLIKE what you are calling backed currencies that are in reality not backed by anything and certainly NOT backed by gold as you suggested."
2018-06-03,"&gt; LN does not have global consensus state.

Right, and that is exactly why it scales much better, can instantly confirm transactions and even improves privacy.

Agreeing on a global state requires broadcasting each transaction to the entire network, waiting for few confirmations and forever storing all of them on every node. 

Understanding how LN manages to instantly confirm a transaction while involving *only the participants of that transaction* is not very easy and requires grasping some smart contracs concepts like multisig and htlc in addition to the basic workings of Bitcoin. 

The information is out there for anyone who's intrested to learn or even try, but admittedly only few make the effort. The rest are suspectable to all sorts of FUD using manipulative metaphors like the above.

LN does not involve ""tokens"", or the ability of ""printing money out of thin air"".  There's no way to ""remove the backing"" or anything of that sort.

2018-06-03,"BTC v BCH
This is a good juncture to touch on the recent Bitcoin Cash (BCH) fork from Bitcoin (BTC)
in August and the subsequent community ideological split behind them following the
abandonment of the 2x fork in November. BTC appears to be focusing first on being a
censorship-resistant store of value and improving its scalability over the long term, foremost
through second-layer solutions; BCH is focused on immediate payments competitiveness
through on-chain scaling. At the time of writing, BCH is cheaper for payments than BTC,
acceptance of BCH for payments appears to be growing, and there are doubts in some
quarters about both the timing and degree of success of BTC’s second-layer scaling efforts.
On the other hand, BCH is seen as weaker as a store of value and to have a weaker
development team. BCH would just be another alt-coin as far as BTC is concerned but for
(a) potential user confusion due to the similarity of the names and the ownership of the
domain bitcoin.com by one of BCH’s promoters, who actively claims that BCH is the ‘true
Bitcoin’; (b) the fact that BCH and BTC share and compete for the same hash power; and (c)
the fact that BCH is being promoted by individuals with significant BTC holdings, who run
large exchanges and wallet companies and hold sway over a significant amount (maybe more
than 50% collectively) of hash power. Factor (b) raises the concern that, because BTC’s
difficulty adjustment is fortnightly while BCH’s is daily, a significant increase in the price of
BCH relative to BTC would cause hash power to swing away from BTC to BCH, slowing or
halting BTC block times until the next BTC difficulty adjustment.33
 Factor (c) means that
BCH’s main backers may try to attack BTC by various means with a non-zero probability of
success.
This blog post and this blog post go into scenarios in which the price of BCH could increase
in the short run relative to the price of BTC. In a nutshell, if such price swings are temporary,
so should be the disruption caused by them, and as a store of value BTC is less sensitive
(store-of-value use implies generally larger, less time-sensitive transactions) to this kind of
short term disruption than BCH is as a means of payment (generally smaller, time-sensitive

33 You can follow the swings in hashrate between BTC and BCH here. 
22
transactions). Furthermore, this disruption in block times assumes transaction fees are held
constant, but in reality transaction fees can adjust upwards to defend against short term
attacks to keep hash power allocated to BTC and keep blocks moving, especially again
because BTC functions more as a store of value than as a means of payment and as such is
less sensitive to fluctuations in transaction fees.
The easiest and most prudent way to hedge against this risk is simply to own the same
number of both tokens.
34 But if forced to get off the fence, the implications of the investment
thesis laid out in this paper are that we should bet on store-of-value strength over means-ofpayment
strength, as we expect the former to be worth more than the latter over time. By
focusing on the competitive and commoditised payments space, BCH is fighting for a place
in a structurally fragmented use case where it doesn’t really seem to do anything new or
better compared to existing payment rail cryptocurrencies such as Dash and Litecoin,
35 not to
mention the sovereign digital currencies that will soon appear; BTC is currently out ahead on
its own as the leading crypto monetary store of value, a use case that is less prone to
fragmentation and more likely to be dominated by a single cryptoasset. If BTC is the
stronger store of value, it should remain more valuable than BCH and profit-driven miners
should continue to allocate more hash power to it over the long run. Tortoise and hare-style,
there’s also a good chance that BTC’s various second-layer development efforts will make it
more relevant for payments, smart contracts and the like over time, providing potential
upsides beyond the core store-of-value case.

2018-06-03,"This isn't true at all.  You can only use your Bitcoin's if you have enough space on the blockchain.  If blockchain space is full on the main chain due to a quota on block space being set by the Core development team then only a fraction of the total Bitcoin on the Lightning Network can be withdrawn at one time.  But there was a reason the video was titled ""Segwit a Fractionally Reserved Blockchain"" rather than ""Segwit a Fractionally Reserved Banking System"".  A fractionally reserved blockchain means the blockchain is fractionally reserved, not the money in the bank's vaults.  If you don't understand the difference then you aren't listening, nor do you really understand Austrian economics.  Again, its a fractionally reserved blockchain because there is only a fraction of the blockchain stored in reserve that is required if everyone tried to withdraw their Bitcoin from the Lightning Network.  Just like how in fractional reserve banking you only store a fraction of gold in reserve at your bank if everyone tried to withdraw their gold from your bank.  It's not the Bitcoin's that are fractionally reserved, its the blockchain."

2018-06-03,Who pays for the AWS instance. I’d rather not end up paying $5 (+extra aws charges) a month for a cloud instance. Why not just wait for Neutrino. There’s a reason why current Bitcoin wallets don’t do this.
2018-06-03,"Because it is money. And it is capped money supply so it is money that appreciates. The appreciation is why you buy in in the first place. Then because it is money, once you have it, why would you not use it?

Granted first the market needs to mature so that people don't think they are gonna miss out on lots of gains by spending it now instead of waiting, but that's no different than selling back to fiat at a given time. Also LN needs to be really ready to go before it will get really useful as money.

Really it comes down to: people will use easy payment methods that they are given. So the question is really why would merchants adopt Bitcoin for payments. And the answer is that it saves them money. LN payments will save them them from the entirety of credit card fees. Plus they get that money instantly instead of having to wait days and days.

So in terms of buying things it is really that Bitcoin (with LN) is a much better option for merchants than accepting credit cards, therefore they will eventually accept Bitcoin payments, and once the LN is widespread and easy to use and the means of getting into the Bitcoin ecosystem are lowered, then at the very least bitcoin is on an even playing field to consumers as credit cards. Except that with Bitcoin you actually control your own money instead of the bank so its actually better."

Quantum computing is no threat to Bitcoin, that has been debunked many times. When they become available (in a few decades) open source bitcoin will have adjusted its protocol long in advance. Bitcoin is antifragile, the more is attacked, the stronger it gets. And when the age comes where quantum computers ARE a threat, both the bad guys and the good guys, and the average citizen, will have them. It'll be much like it is now. Most progress made in the hardware industry is pretty linear. Worrying about quantum computers right now is certainly a waste of energy, given that quantum computers are still in their infantile stages, and can only operate at absolute zero temperatures. (Hint: It's an extremely difficult job to find a way to bring absolute zero cooling methods to the consumer market.). While ECDSA is indeed not secure under quantum computing, quantum computers don't yet exist and probably won't for a while. The DWAVE system often written about in the press is, even if all their claims are true, not a quantum computer of a kind that could be used for cryptography.
Bitcoin's security, when used properly with a new address on each transaction, depends on more than just ECDSA: Cryptographic hashes are much stronger than ECDSA under QC. Bitcoin's security was designed to be upgraded in a forward compatible way and could be upgraded if this were considered an imminent threat.

2018-06-03,"10 crypto commandments off the top of my head

1) Markets move fast, Patience and strategy win the game. Having a buy strategy is easy. Sell strategy can be more challenging. Come up with something a little more sophisticated than HODL...because there has to be an endpoint somewhere

2) if you are losing sleep over this you are overly invested.

3) unless you are skilled and know what you’re doing, i recommend that you do not day-trade

4) do research, read white papers. There’s a lot of convincing propaganda especially here on Reddit. Learn to sift through the bullshit and hold conversations on substance. Seek reliable sources on your information to make thoughtful decisions. Seek to make investments in projects that you think will grow and mature in 3-5 years.

5) fomo is emotional, and you do not want to make emotionally charged decisions with your investments.

6) create a thoughtful, balanced and diversified portfolio that is built up overtime. 

7) Consider DCA (dollar cost averaging in) with an investment amount that does not break your finances or quality of life. Invest only what you can and prepare to see everything go to 0. 

8) Be careful how many times a day you check the price of crypto. If you are making longer term investments the price right now, or 5 mins from now won’t make a difference on what you do... so go live life and get off your phone.

9) Engage with a community of people, trade ideas, get active in the movement. Be a catalyst and an activist in the projects you believe in. You don’t have to be a tech person to be part of the movement.

10) have fun. This is an amazing time to be alive. Welcome to the club."

2018-06-03,I don’t see why using only Bitcoin and not voting favors using only Bitcoin and voting. Using Bitcoin is definitely great I think but not voting doesn’t help much while with voting you have at least some influence in the direction of legislation as a collective at least.

That bitcoin is a type of digital asset that is valued in fiat terms and subsequently gets bought and sold for fiat to hopefully increase one's fiat wealth. 

The last thing they want ANYONE to think is that.

It makes me angry when people equate downvotes with censorship and oppression. They are two very, very, very different things. Downvotes are not preventing your speech from being seen or heard, but I have been forcibly ejected from the BTC community for the heinous crime of suggesting a change to the scaling plan. I am *persona non grata* and my ideas are unwelcome, despite having spent years learning the tech and having demonstrated a firm grasp on the structure of the source code.

I have **every fucking right to be angry.** I spent years developing tech for Bitcoin, only for the Bitcoin Core team to make that tech *worthless*. When I stand up for Bitcoin tech, I get personally attacked. When I stand up for free speech, I get accused of oppression. All I wanted was a Bitcoin that works, and apparently the egregious crime of *attempting to transact Bitcoin* is enough to justify personal attacks, DM harassment, bans, dox attempts, blacklisting, and hack attempts against my accounts.

Now take that situation and combine it with the annoyance of an everlasting parade of Reddit nobodies that casually latch on to terminology such as ""oppression"" and categorically misuse the term, and maybe - just maybe - you will have an inkling of an idea of *why* so many of us get so upset when such a gross mischaracterization is made."

2018-06-03,"Hello TheBitDaily,


To get a complete picture and understanding of the implications that blockchain technology brings forth, we would recommend the **Blockchain Revolution** written by Dan and Alex Tapscott. This book focusses more on the actual use cases of the blockchain technology and its potential. It also sketches a possible future across a number of industries and the they discuss the impact that the blockchain technology might have.

Another suggestion for getting a better understanding of the blockchain is the book written by Melanie Swan: **Blockchain: Blueprint for a new economy**. This book focusses more on the underlying technology of bitcoin, the blockchain. The book covers the application of blockchain in the industries where it could have the most positive impact namely: the government, software, healthcare and research sector.

With kind regards,

&gt; Bitcoin the currency is still Bitcoin the currency, Bitcoin Cash is not Bitcoin the currency. **The idea of bitcoin** however is alive and well in Bitcoin Cash, much more than it is in Bitcoin.

the idea of bitcoin, of a peer-to-peer electronic cash system that the world could use to pay each other without having to ask permission, without having to submit to some authority, that idea is why many of us bought BTC to begin with. Then some people came along and tried to pervert BTC, to change it so that it's no longer true to that idea. Last Christmas with its $50 average fees on the BTC network has shown conclusively that they've succeeded.

BTC may be Bitcoin, but it's no longer true to that idea of bitcoin, and if in the future the only way to use BTC is to use LN then it will have strayed even further from its permissionless ideals. BCH on the other hand is still true to that idea of bitcoin that made me buy BTC back in the day. BCH is not Bitcoin, no, but it's the bitcoin I've wanted since 2015"

But hey, I’m just hagenjustyn and this is a FILM THEORY. "
2018-06-03,"Nope. Not at all what I was saying. Nor is that the logic I was using. But this topic is a matter of perspective which is obvious we disagree on. At first there was a single bitcoin. Since that single point beginning there have been and will most likely continue to be forks of the bitcoin project. As such each fork should have its own name to avoid confusion. The value of the forks is not really relevant. But it should be easy to distinguish which fork we are talking about from one another. I do not think you disagree with that. I am not at all advocating that the BTC chain have to change it's name every time a new fork is made. I did not imply that. Once again it seems to me that your measure of what makes bitcoin and my measure of what makes bitcoin are different things. It seems pretty clear to me that you think there is only 1 true real legit official bitcoin and that every thing else is a clone or copy. We will not be able to agree on what is and what is not bitcoin. That is ok. Once again I am not advocating at all to rename it to Bitcoin Core or Bcore or anything along those lines. I think I have been pretty clear about that. I was asking you for a neutral naming convention which you think is unnecessary. To clarify I completely understand that the coin is different from the network and from the implementation.  I am aware that the CORE implementation is indeed different than the Knots implementation. I am aware that Bitcoin Classic and Unlimited XT etc are all different things too.  I am also aware that there are many forks of bitcoin including gold, private, cash, pizza, classhic etc. Though I have to admit I have not looked deeply into any version of bitcoin beyond the BTC and BCH versions so I can not comment on the strengths or weaknesses or validity of them. I could go on listing the things I am aware of but it is a waste of time.   To summarize I think the BTC chain should have a unique name to help differentiate it from the other types of bitcoins that is not offensive or ""misleading"" (Core, Bcore). You think ""Bitcoin"" by itself is fine and offered no suggestion.  I disagree. The end. "

Alleged confusion is also a way for small blockers to deny reality. They claim everyone supporting Bitcoin Cash are either scammers or confused by the scammers."
2018-06-03,"I'm not convinced crypto would've helped with that amount of money?

I guess it depends what kind of bank account the family had, sending $58,000 to an exchange - say, coinbase - would certainly raise flags with many banks here in the UK, I'm not sure about the USA. 

This is just another reason why banks suck - any transaction over a certain amount will be blocked without prior arrangement. To arrange this kind of transfer, would mean some kind of interview with the bank, lots of questions, proof where the money came from - a lengthy and annoying process.

Then they would possibly come up against limits at coinbase, having to verify an account first, which can take ages. 

All this would likely have to be done via a translator, as it's stated the family have limited english skills.

It's therefore entirely possible their money would've been held up at any point in the transaction, there's plenty of cases of people trying to transfer large amounts via coinbase and getting it stuck for weeks or months.

The only other alternative, would've been risky ""black market"" bitcoin trade. I don't know about you, but I certainly wouldn't want to trust $58000 to someone I've never met, doing a bitcoin transaction.

2018-06-03,"I think it’s mostly fair response. I figured doing shorter type of post for once but that probably doesn’t fit so well with such complex topic yes. 

I indeed don’t know what’s optimal inflation and tend to believe that from societies perspective at least some low number is better. This post also is not directly so relevant for well functioning society with a low stable inflation, However I do believe it’s somewhat dangerous to put too much power/trust in todays and future governments regardless of your country and I think some debts are out of control. Several relatively considered decently/ well developed countries have had their wealth (hyper)inflated away in the past also. I think governments (and for that matter maybe also banks (too big to fail/ baillout stuff) are througout history irresponsible with this power to bring more money in circulation and it’s mainly just never distributed in a fair way. Governments also get to spend more than it’s citizins might want if they had taxed in a more transaparant and straight way compared to making their savings and income (if it doesn’t grow enough with it) worth less for the sake of being able to overspend more as it can just bring ‘quantitative easing’ in play (such transparant and great naming btw!). The way quantitative easing is done isn’t that fair imo.

One should be free to choose it’s own money and not be forced upon a system that’s open for exploitation and can (/have/does) steal countries wealth overnight in cases. Whether economically unclear whether a push towards Bitcoin is overal beneficial (for some countries it is but maybe/pbb not for all) I think for individuals it will continue to be more and more incentivised as opposed to using fiat that is being printed."

Your argument is anti intellectual in nature.

2018-06-03,"What prevents the following scenario (not all at once, of course, but boiling frogs, as with everything the government does):

1. LN catches on with BTC users as a convenient way to transact. As designed, you can't load LN channels with more BTC than you have.

2. The government starts accepting e.g. tax payments through LN channels, and paying people through LN. As designed, receiving an LN credit is still as good as receiving a Ledger Nano loaded with BTC private keys.

3. The government passes laws to twist the arms of LN developers and node operators to change its fundamental design: there is no longer a 1:1 relationship between LN and BTC. Certain highly trusted parties, like the government can now temporarily fund LN channels for more BTC than they are willing to relinquish control of at that moment, but it's still fully redeemable. After all, the government is the biggest holder of BTC in the world and everyone's not going to close their LN channels all at once revealing there's more ""BTC"" in LN channels than actually exist on the main chain. Those developers and node operators who won't cooperate with this redesign are fined, imprisoned, or replaced; after all this an emergency measure to fund a shortfall in Medicare and Social Security. They must want old people to die in the streets.

4. LN channels open with the government are still redeemable for BTC, but with restrictions.

5. LN is further redesigned to completely untether from BTC. After all, everyone is using LN channel credits all the time anyway. Who cares about that environmentally disastrous ""barbarous relic"" called PoW-secured crypto when we've got the LN operating at lightning speed and backed by the full faith and credit of the government?

And if you want to again insist that no one can possibly change the design of LN without changing the base layer, then please explain why that is. What makes it technically, economically, or practically impossible to change the relationship of LN to BTC?"

**Berlin**

Berlin (, German: [bɛɐ̯ˈliːn] ( listen)) is the capital and the largest city of Germany, as well as one of its 16 constituent states. With a steadily growing population of approximately 3.7 million, Berlin is the second most populous city proper in the European Union behind London and the seventh most populous urban area in the European Union. Located in northeastern Germany on the banks of the rivers Spree and Havel, it is the centre of the Berlin-Brandenburg Metropolitan Region, which has roughly 6 million residents. Due to its location in the European Plain, Berlin is influenced by a temperate seasonal climate.

***

**London**

London ( ( listen) LUN-dən) is the capital and most populous city of England and the United Kingdom. Standing on the River Thames in the south east of the island of Great Britain, London has been a major settlement for two millennia. It was founded by the Romans, who named it Londinium. London's ancient core, the City of London, largely retains its 1.12-square-mile (2.9 km2) medieval boundaries.

So you are saying that every time someone forks Bitcoin it needs to change its name? Bitcoin has been forked many times. Bitcoin Cash is not the only one. Under your logic it would first be Bitcoin Core, then Bitcoin Core Gold forks, we rename Bitcoin Core to Bitcoin Core Classic, then when Bitcoin Core Classic Private forks, we rename Bitcoin Core Classic to Bitcoin Core Classic Legacy...

As an example of how other multi version projects do naming, in open source software, the vetsion that forks off takes a new name to differentiate itself from the original. For clarity this makes perfect sense. Open source software projects seem to handle this problem pretty well.

And even if you are going to rename the original, dont add to the confusion even more by giving it the name of a software implementation of the network. To me that shows either ignorance or insidious intent."

My point was that others don't see it that way and I believe it would help Bitcoin Cash quite a bit to elaborate on the ""Bitcoin Cash is the real Bitcoin"" statement.  The rest of the crypto community sees it as part of the propaganda campaign and it's become a meme at this point.  It's not helping BCH at all."

2018-06-03,"Well the difference between $7,800 and $8,400 is about 7%, and like I mentioned it charges $5 + 6%... So do the math, if I only sold $100 worth, $5 is 5% of 100 + 6% ($6) I would only get $89 worth at the $8,400 price... So it isn't really worth it unless you are selling really big amounts, which I'm not made of money, and the machine probably has a transaction size limit... Not really worth it to try to spend thousands of dollars of crypto to chase a 1% gain..."
2018-06-03,Found a great site that tracks crypto currency scams. They are all listed here sorted by market cap https://coinmarketcap.com. 
2018-06-03,"I understand what you're trying to suggest. You want to increase adoption as fast as possible by allowing use cases that require zero fee transactions, but what happens when eventually you have to charge fees? And when will that point be? All these use cases will suddenly not be viable. How exactly is bulking up your numbers going to help achieve real adoption? When you give something away for free and you plan to start charging for it in the future, is this really adoption at all? 

At least you're concerned about the real issue with Bitcoin cash though. Personally the 32mb blocksize is incredibly reckless in my opinion. In just 14 years almost 99% of coins will have been mined and the block reward will be just 0.78125 BCH. Obviously even as a BTC supporter I hope BCH gains adoption but developers are making huge risky assumptions at the risk of security. For example what happens if in 14 years that BCH is only hitting 16MB worth of transactions (all paying a fee). At an average rate of $0.15 per kb that equals just $2400 of fees to miners. Meaning the value of one BCH has to be around $15,000 just to equal the current reward miners get at the moment. You might feel this is perfectly plausible, and maybe it is, it wouldn't surprise me, but its a very long way from a certainty, a VERY long way. Bitcoin has been around for more than ten years and I firmly believe that we wouldn't even fill 2mb blocks if we had them. Sure, during peak bubble times we would, but that's a bad metric to base things on. For developers to make these kind of reckless decisions is very unprofessional when dealing with people's money. "

2018-06-03,"So for those of you who are wondering what coins are relatively underpriced, I am keeping track of how much each coin of my interest is up since BTC bottomed out near 7.2K.   The big ""loser"" here is TRX but it is understandable as it got dumped pretty bad before the mainnet launch (whereas it did very well in mid/late May when everything was tanking).   Percentage changes since 5/29 til now

1.  IOTA:  +45.6%
2.  ONT:  +39.7%
3.  ZIL:  +30.7%
4.  ICX:  +30.3%
5.  BTS:  +26.4%
6.  VEN:  +25.6%
7.  BNB:  +24.2%
8.  ENG:  +21.6%
9.  XLM:  +21%
10.  Nano:  +20.8%
11.  XVG:  +17.7%
12.  ETH:  +17.3%
13.  STRAT:  +15.2%
14.  BTC:  +8.6%
15.  TRX:  +2.9%

With everything else being equal, Nano is still underperforming given that it dropped really hard in May but is not recovering as fast as some of the other coins.  This either means that there is a huge run coming or Nano is slowly fading.  I don't think there is an in-between scenario here, making Nano investment very high risk/high reward in June. "

No, we don't hold any keys. Rafa developed a very clever system. Our server only links $handles with productid \(like a number that identifies your phone\), so when you send to a $handle, your wallet asks the server for an address linked to that handle. The server pings to your productid \(phone\), it generates a new address \(to avoid tracking\) and sends a cashaddress back to you so in the background a regular BCH transaction happens. Super cool. 

Also, all connections are encrypted and we have no way to know your keys, etc. Not totally decentraliced right now, but allows us to test the $handle system and enhance it easily BEFORE making it a proposal to include at protocol level for ALL Bitcoin Cash apps / services."

Bitcoin Cash was born by a split *within* the Bitcoin community about what Bitcoin should be and how it should develop. 

You speak of the right of the community. ""Bitcoin"" is not yours to police, nor is it Core’s to ruin. The people in *this* community \(the big\-block bitcoiners — now Bitcoin Cash\) have as much right to work on ensuring the success of Satoshi’s idea as anyone else. "

Surplus value and profit incentives in investing make competing stores of value redundant and drastically inefficient.  Having to rely on open market demand/supply of a medium exchange creates a second layer of economic dead-weight (there is someone profiting off the currency and the commodity it was traded for in each trade) [sorry im not the best at explaining this].  This may sound like anti-crypto speak (or worse maximalism lol), but the influence of blockchain related public trust and decentralization of industry will, in my opinion, prove vastly more important in creating a better economy.

ASIC farms just go to places where it's relatively cheap. We are in fact probably somewhat concentrated in China. In China the the cost to mine a Bitcoin is little above 3000$. Add some western countries where it's slightly more expensive. 


Average cost to mine a Bitcoin is somewhat 4000-5000$ and it definitely *can* go below that level, for short periods of time.

""Fnord"" () is a word coined in 1965 by Kerry Thornley and Greg Hill in the Principia Discordia. It entered the popular culture after appearing in The Illuminatus! Trilogy (1975) of satirical and parody conspiracy fiction novels by Robert Shea and Robert Anton Wilson. In these novels, the interjection ""fnord"" is given hypnotic power over the unenlightened, and children in grade school are taught to be unable to consciously see the word ""fnord"".

2018-06-03,"&gt; That being said, I currently actually DO use my ETH for something, and no, it's not the multitudes of collectibles dapps. ;) Those are getting pretty tired, to be honest. But if you look, there ARE other dapps doing more than just allowing you to buy fun pictures for ETH. That is all in what you perceive to be valuable as a dapp, though. I can understand if you also don't see the value in microblogging or bounty dapps (as a few examples of those that are currently working).

What's a bounty dapp? Microblogging? Feel free to add how it adds value, beyond what a normal blog would do. Don't even know what the other thing is. I could google it now. Fuck it. 

So I googled and found bounty rewards for bug fixes. That doesn't seem to new. Last update seemed to be March. Still kinda drunk. Not sure I understand what I'm seeing. The other google result was sports betting and some kind of fantasy team thing with a ref system? 


&gt; To comment on ERC-20, it would seem that the standard has been proposed to be either modified or at least added to many times. It is the first standard of tokens on the ETH network, which doesn't mean much in the grand scheme. Firsts are usually always overcome, or at least updated and made to evolve over the course of their lifetime. That's just my outlook on it, but I can't really speak too much since I am hardly a coder/programmer/developer myself. I just try to read, learn, and gauge feeling from those who are.


Can't say that made all too much sense to me. Feel free to try again, if you don't bother, fine. 

&gt; I am interested to see where Casper, GHOST, and quadratic sharding go, even if they don't all necessarily pan out

Not sure if you understood my original comment, but without the implementation of these things, Ethereum will eventually hit a dead end. So whilst you think it may fail, but you're hopeful, that's kind of irrelevant, because if it doesn't work out, Ethereum will be fucked, because as they operate right now, they're limited in their use. 

&gt; It is good for you (and me) to be more independently aware and to not be part of a hype train. It is also good for us to be critical even of the projects we like and may even currently use.


Coins are not football teams. You pledge no alliance with them. You buy and sell. They're highly liquid goods, you can sell whenever you feel like it. There's no reason to become a cultist and HODL and never sell. It's one click, one minute away. 

That's how I see it anyway. I traded the EOS hype and made profit. Now I'm out and allocated profits back to Bitcoin. 


&gt; As for downvotes, don't let them get to you. 

Thanks a lot. I guess it's just frustrating to see. See my account. I'm writing these walls out of goodwill, pretty much looking for people that approach and tell me where it exactly my logic is flawed. 


I guess it's kind of like what women do. You heard of shittesting? Essentially I'm throwing shit at projects, legit shit - not stupid and baseless arguments, in order to somewhat force people to try and debunk my shit. Sometimes they can do it. Most of the time they just fail and resort to emotional responses. 

This tactic is highly efficient for women. Chances are if you cannot handle the shit, something is up. That's how I see it anyway. If you fail at debunking my shit, my conclusion is these people haven't understood and are amateurs, or the project is simply shit.

Have you read the article I linked? That's essentially my primary concern with Ethereum. I'm not able to tell who's right in the scaling debate. Both perspectives make sense to me. 


However, and I'm not sure you understood that, if the perspective against Ethereum holds merrit, they'll hit a dead end eventually and fail. 

Increasing the blocksize is not a solution to scaling. Gas prices are determined by miners - so essentially there is no cap, despite Vitalik having claimed exactly that. 

I'm just confused, and I'm not a gambler. That's why I stay away, and will stay way, unless they have sorted out their problems. 


I'm not afraid to short-term trade Ethereum, to get myself more Bitcoin, but that's really it. That's what I do with Alts in general. They mean nothing to me, they can be pump and dump, they can be scams, it's okey to trade them short-term, because price don't give no fuck about rationality in bubble markets. 

So I'm using these garbage fires to increase my BTC holdings over time.

Is that so complicated? If i was running a node in 2009, it would still sync the Bitcoin blockchain today. It would not sync the Bitcoin cash blockchain. So how can you possibly say BCH is the real Bitcoin?

Now, I understand that the whitepaper says it is peer to peer digital cash etc etc. But Litecoin is still peer to peer digital cash, does this make it Bitcoin? What about if I start a new coin today identical to BCH, is that now bitcoin too?

Please, stop being disingenuous with the whole ""the whitepaper says"" argument. I could literally start copy and paste altcoin for any open source crypto at any time but it does not make it ""the real Xcoin"". Not saying Bitcoin Cash is that, but this definition of ""does it do what the whitepaper says"" is just silly.

That's a big fucking deal. So go shout that message to the masses rather than this silly ""bitcoin cash is the real Bitcoin"" nonsense.

I have also made a free Android app that helps businesses (coffee shops, restaurants, etc) accepting crypto easily. Currently for crypto fans (they need their own wallets / storage). Check it out on [ moonposapp.com](https://moonposapp.com).

It is not just about the technology, for me, it is mostly about the philosophy and that is what I am sharing firsthand. If you spark the interest about ""Why use crypto"", people will want to hear ""How it works""."

2018-06-03,"The network split last year in August of 2017.  Users of each coin will claim they are the ""real"" Bitcoin.  But the overwhelming majority of the businesses in the industry calls BTC ""Bitcoin"" and refers to BCH as ""Bitcoin Cash"".

BTC currently is currently higher in terms of price, traffic, adoption, and developer activity.  It is pursuing a scaling path that involves constraining the blocksize and pursuing various second layer (L2) technologies to make it usable by more people.  There is also considerable research going on into fungibility/anonymity and increasing blockspace efficiency in various ways.

BCH took a much smaller proportion of the community with it, but is more popular in this particular subreddit.  Its proponents will tell you that BTC is only more popular because certain social media outlets misled people.  At a technical level, they have opted for a simpler approach: to allow block sizes to increase as a scaling solution, and disagree with BTC's decision to keep them constrained.

Whichever is more ""real"" is up to you :)"

2018-06-03,"Part of it is Reddit's fault honestly.  Its so easy to just ""ban"" someone and then they are gone forever...or so you think.  Unfortunately, that is not how reality works.  They can still post you just won't see what they say.  Its a really poor way of dealing with a counter argument.  But..before I joined reddit I had never seen such a broad rejection of counter opinions...people just ban and thats it, often without even thinking about what the person is saying.  Its...a really stupid level of discourse.   You can be on Youtube and get a better level of discussion lol...lots of stupid posts..but people are actually exposed..to all thinking, no matter how stupid...just banning is not using your mind.  Its an issue with Reddit itself as they make it quite easy to create some kind of false ""safe space""..which I have never seen to such extent on ANY other platform.

Which is what gets you...such insular thinking and cult\-like atmosphere's.  I have only banned 1 person EVER on this thing, and I actually want to un\-ban them now.  \(enough time has passed, and they were even borderline harassing me asking the same question repeatedly...\)  Unless someone is actually harassing someone..just banning is stupid.  Deal with critisicm.   Learn from it.  Reddit helps enable this behavior and allows for over\-zealous moderation..as there is 0 recourse as mods can pretty much ban and block for whatever they want..as simple not liking what you are saying.   This is a problem as it creates such stupid, insular, and thoughtLESS conversation at that point. 

I don't know the solution...except to have people be more open to discussing negative things about their coins, and have moderators not be so quick to take the easy way out and press a button.  As if that will solve a coins problems \(or anything.\)   IMO reddit should make it harder to ban people from forums and not allow bans unless it is for harassing behavior, and not anything related to content that people just happen to not like. 

This is not just a crypto problem....but more of a cultural problem and a problem that Reddit further enables..."

2018-06-03,I have heard the theory that large mining operations (who also happen to be Bitcoin whales) have fixed overhead costs which set the price requirement to be above a key threshold eg $xxxx and if it begins to fall below this level they will initiate large buy orders to push it back up. Depending on the size of the set up the fixed o/h will set a minimum price per coin that the miner must realise to maintain the op. They can't just wind down fixed costs because the price of the coin drops to say 3000. I may be be way off but I know when Futures were being rolled out this was a regular topic that came up and that for this reason some miners will use Futures contracts to hedge against this risk.

&gt; The gold standard was changed under everyone's feet yes. But that's isn't a cryptographical secured global consensus system. The government did not need to ask every single user to change the rules they just did.

Yes, the hurdles might be higher due to the cryptographic link to the base chain. Fair enough.

But with LN you are going from a settlement to an IOU (that you can maybe settle). The ""fractional teller"" banking problem.

That's the first step. The second is to start hiding the base layer. Given that there's already talk to make LN work across different block chains, this is not really far-reaching speculation.

Any perks or revenue they do end up giving you can be changed and voided in a heartbeat. There is nothing that protects you against their insider trading either. Should anything ever go wrong to the company, maybe a fatal error in their code, maybe their office burns down, or maybe they get fucked during an audit, then THEY are the first ones out, and you ""shareholders"" are the ones holding the bag for months until you read about it on some blog where you may consider yourself lucky to sell the final breadcrumbs before it gets delisted.

"
2018-06-03,"I think it's important to remember that, whilst Bitcoin certainly still needs improvement, Satoshi presented to the world a complete, coded design which he had been working on for 1.5 years. That is to say, he didn't come up with an idea for peer\-to\-peer e\-cash that everyone is now trying to 'fill in'; he presented a more or less complete solution to the problems involved in designing such a system, which includes scalability. 

As I see it, the position of the big\-block bitcoiners in this subreddit is not to deify Satoshi for Satoshi's sake, but rather to do two things: \(1\) point to the fact that Bitcoin need not have a ""scaling problem"" if only we follow the actual design; \(2\) demonstrate why this design will work, and discuss its relative merits in comparison with other scaling models. 

For some reason the first point also seems to involve the necessity of proving that Satoshi *actually thought* the network should scale by blocksize. Which is absurd, as we can see from Satoshi's *second* email that this was always the assumption:

&gt;Long before the network gets anywhere near as large as that \[hundreds of millions of people are doing transactions\], it would be safe  for users to use Simplified Payment Verification \(section 8\) to check for double spending, which only requires having the chain of block headers, or about 12KB per day. Only people trying to create new coins would need to run  network nodes. At first, most users would run network nodes, but as the  network grows beyond a certain point, it would be left more and more to  specialists with server farms of specialized hardware. A server farm would  only need to have one node on the network and the rest of the LAN connects with that one node.  

But the more important point is that, in addition to referring to Satoshi's scaling design the big\-blockers in this subreddit also have to show why the small\-blockers are wrong to think that scaling by SPV nodes compromises network security. But in order to do this, we also have to return to many of the issues that Satoshi raised in the white paper in response to the double spending problem. 

So, insisting that we return to the white paper is not an empty deification of Satoshi. Rather, it is often an attempt to show that Bitcoin had a brilliant scaling design from the very beginning, and that the so\-called compromises implied by this model are actually non\-problems for network functionality and security.

If you are interested in how all of this fits together to allow scaling for billions of users, I can't recommend Peter Rizun's presentation more highly: [https://youtu.be/MvM055u4bm4](https://youtu.be/MvM055u4bm4)"

You're right, we have Bitcoin. There's no way you can call BCash digital hard money. It's centralized and vulnerable to attacks. It's also shit liquidity and the network effect divergence between Bitcoin and BCash has been diverging in Bitcoin's favor since last years split. Metcalfe's law, hashing power and decentralization matter. BCash doesn't even come close.

&gt;Projects should be built around that. 

Yes, not on-chain with OP codes. These were turned off for a reason and should remain off. Only idiots think it's worthwhile to waste the blockchain in this way. You don't even need to do these things on chain. You can use LN or something else.

Nodes will not accept a transaction that doesn't follow the rules.

No offense, but your post evokes a certain stereotype in me, that of a logical, intelligent but absolutely *black and white* thinking individual who reiterates his points and detailed technical knowledge, regardless of how applicable it is to a situation and dynamic that happens on a completely different level.

With the difference that with BCH the global village ledger will be in everyone's face, whereas with LN plus a SWIFT style settlement layer, it will be *somewhere on a Raspberry Pi* in an Attic. Oh, and, beware of the Leopard.

\(1\) People need the app ""an upgrade for gold and reserve currency"". 

\(2\) There needs to be just one distributed protocol to satisfy this need.

\(3\) By far, BTC has the best chances to remain that one. Part of it that this application doesn't really require much technical sophistication, in comparative terms.

\(4\) There are probably hundreds of other applications out there but none of them is obvious yet. Large consultancies such as Deloiite and IBM promote only optimisation of supply chains and complex sales. Internet applications did not modernise businesses that existed before, they were primarily built on top of new business models. 

\(5\) A responsible investor with average risk aversion can not be satisfied with the degree of development for other applications yet. Some people may invest into some specific companies being certain about their teams but generally it makes no sense yet to invest in crypto besides BTC.

This isn't quite true.  The send of the funds could create a channel for the receive at the very time it is sent.

For example:

Alice has 10 BTC.
Bob has 0 BTC.

Alice wants to send Bob 1 BTC in a lightning channel.

The two of them open up a lightning channel with each other, funded entirely by Alice, where the initial channel state has 1 BTC in Bob's control.

Bob has just received 1 BTC in a lightning channel from Alice, despite not having any bitcoins at the beginning of the scenario."

2018-06-03,"&gt; It's not my place to prove whether LN works or not

Of course.  I never said or implied otherwise.

&gt; it's the LN devs responsibility to either release the working product (hasn't been done) or release a whitepaper explaining in detail how all parts of the system work (also hasn't been done). A detailed explanation of whatever new routing algorithm which needs to be designed will be the first step for me.

It seems likely to me that the current working version will continue to be iterated upon to improve its usefulness.

You seem to think it is likely there is a limit on how large it can possibly grow that is substantially lower than those of us in BTC expect.

I'm trying to figure what that limit is, and how you and I can, in the future, know if LN is being constrained by it, or has broken through it.  Are you able to help me figure out what that is?  Then you and I can both reach a concrete way for us to get closer to the truth :)

&gt; Development is great, no issue with it. But betting your present and near-future success on an unproven, yet-to-be-made technology rather than doing what Bitcoin has been doing successfully for years prior - increasing block size - is incompetent.

I think you are misunderstanding our reasoning.  It does *not* go:

- [A] This lightning network thing looks like it will solve our scaling problems.

- [B] We can afford to restrict blocksize because [A].

In fact, our reasoning goes like this:

- (1) Blocksize increases threaten the censorship resistant nature of Bitcoin.

- (2) We need to look for other methods to scale because (1).

- (3) This Lightning thing looks like it could help a lot with (2).  Let's pursue it (and other things) and see how far it gets us.

Now, I'm aware you probably don't agree with (1), and that's OK.  You have the opportunity to prove us wrong with BCH.

But several arguments you've used here seem to indicate you think we are using the [A][B] reasoning, when in fact we are using the (1)(2)(3) reasoning, so I think that's worth clarifying.  Does that communicate my position more clearly?

&gt; Not increasing the block size when **Lightning itself requires it** is simply malicious.

I'm not ready to fully agree with the bolded claim.

From what I've seen, blocksize increases required for Lightning tend to be based on how channels must be opened/closed from the original paper, but a lot has changed since then.  Are you aware of the paper from last year about [channel factories](https://www.tik.ee.ethz.ch/file/a20a865ce40d40c8f942cf206a7cba96/Scalable_Funding_Of_Blockchain_Micropayment_Networks%20(1\).pdf)?  That's one example of a way to fit a lot more channels into a single transaction than we thought possible.  Combined with signature aggregation, that changes a lot of earlier assumptions about the blockspace needed.

Now, you may turn out to be right - it is possible that we will need larger blocks in the future.  But we certainly don't know for sure yet."

Everyone who wanted bigger block size limits had moved to Bitcoin Cash, so there was basically 100% consensus.  In posting in various BCH communities, I don't know anyone who was opposed to increasing the block size limit to 32mb.  Bigger block size limits is the raison d'être for BCH.

You might be confusing EOS with NEO. Which is 1k TPS which is still insanely superior to ETH already.

2018-06-03,"&gt; Bitcoin Cash represents the mentality that Bitcoin needs both Layer 1 and Layer 2. 

And Bitcoin doesn't?

&gt;The problem was really just the crippling of Layer 1

How is it crippled? We're nowhere near the Segwit ceiling and there are plenty of more developments in the works. Eventually Bitcoin will need to HF to a higher limit, as well, but this is aways off. It's a complete straw man to argue that Bitcoin can never and will never fork. It doesn't make any sense. Most devs are in favor of a HF increase at the appropriate time and consensus around this will build naturally. Only BCash thinks it's appropriate to branch of the network with barely any support. It's fundamentally insecure and diminishes Bitcoin's network. 

&gt;So Bitcoin Cash, while it is a ""Bigger Block Size"" project ... it isn't only that.

It pretty much is though. Turning on OP codes is not some revolutionary innovation. The HF's and ""upgrades"" are just gimmicks designed to hype and pump the coin.

&gt; Its an experiment to do ""both"" layer 1 and 2 ... 

Bitcoin is an experiment to do both layers as well. Also, I seem to remember every BCasher saying layer 2 and LN were the devil. In fact, I still mostly see this sentiment. Which is it, is LN designed by Bilderberg and George Soros or is it coming to BCash once the idiotic developers figure out how to solve malleability? Seems to me that you can't have it both ways.

This doesn't happen in BCH or BTC. So, while he concluded at the end of the article he wasn't worried, he did say, and I'm paraphrasing, the largest mining pool would have .3% more profitability than individual miners/small pools. If you extrapolate this number to a nearly unlimited blocksize, the problem becomes very serious because people have a, potentially large, financial incentive to stay with the most profitable (largest) mining pool.

&gt; I was worried that I would find out 20MB blocks would give big miners a significant advantage before I started working on this post a week ago. I’m not worried any more, but please send me email if there is something I’ve missed.

The reason I linked the paper was because you seemed worried about mining centralization, and the paper goes deep into this, it even mentions it in the abstract of the paper.


&gt; One of the little-known aspects of bitcoin is the nature of the proof of work system. There are many 
people, especially those who support a UASF or PoW change that believe a distributed system should 
be completed as a mesh. In this, they confuse centralised systems with centrality. The truth of the matter, 
no matter which proof of work system is implemented, they all follow a maximal growth curve that 
reflects the nature of the firm as detailed in 1937 by Ronald Coase (1937).  

&gt; The bitcoin White Paper was very specific. users of the system ""vote with their CPU power"" [1]. What 
this means, is that the system was never generated to give one vote per person. It is designed purely 
around economic incentives individuals with more hash power will have provided more investment into 
the system. These individuals who invest more in the system gain more say in the system. At the same 
time, no one or even two individuals can gain complete control of the system. We'll explore the nature 
of cartels in a separately, but these always fail without government intervention. The reason for cartels 
failing comes down to the simple incentivisation of the most efficient member. The strongest cartel 
member always ends up propping up the weakest. This leads to a strategy of defection. 

&gt; No proof of work-based solution ever allows for a scenario where you have one vote to one person. The 
anti-sybiling  functions  of bitcoin  and all  other  related  systems  based  on  proof  of  work or  similar 
derivatives are derived from an investment based strategy. Solutions to the implementation of ASIC 
based systems are constantly proposed as a methodology of limiting the centralisation of proof of work 
systems as it is termed. The truth of the matter is that the mining function within any proof of work 
system naturally aligns to business interests. This leads to corporations running machines within data 
centres. On the way that democracies and republics have migrated away from small groups of people 
individually voting for an outcome towards a vote for a party, the transactional costs associated with 
individual choice naturally leads to corporate solutions. In this, the corporation mirrors a political party. 

&gt; In this paper, we address the issues of using alternate approval work systems with regards to either 
incorporating alternate functions in an extension of simply securing the network against the use of proof 
of work systems to create a one person one vote scenario in place of economic incentivisation. We will 
demonstrate conclusively that all systems migrate to a state of economic efficiency. The consequence 
of this is that systems form into groups designed to maximise returns. The effect is that bitcoin is not 
only incentive compatible but is optimal. No system can efficiently collapse into an order of one vote 
one individual and remain secure. In the firm-based nature of bitcoin, we demonstrate that the inherent 
nature of the firm is reflected within mining pools. Multiple aggregation strategies exist. The strategies 
range from the creation of collective firms where members can easily join or leave (mining pools) 
through to more standard corporate structures.  

Mining won't be completely centralized but it will be corporatized with competing factions competing in a form of a Stackelberg game.  There will be market leaders and followers who at times are overthrown.  This is how the economic incentivization of Bitcoin works.  Jameson Lopp also has [an interesting article about the future of mining](https://medium.com/@lopp/the-future-of-bitcoin-mining-ac9c3dc39c60), in which he also notes how ASIC proliferation and innovation causes centralized entitites and market leaders to emerge and eventually they are overthrown as technology advances.  This is seen with Ghash.io for example who had 51% at one time [and Peter Todd got scared and sold half his bitcoins](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/281ftd/why_i_just_sold_50_of_my_bitcoins_ghashio/), but now ghash.io is nothing significant.  This illustrates how economic incentivization is what runs Bitcoin.  "
2018-06-03,"I roll my blunts with bitcoin every day too, and I don't even smoke."
2018-06-03,"I agree that in the long\-term, the majority will win, but it's plain wrong to think that what non\-mining users do does not matter at all. They are an extremely valuable part of the \*incentive\* for miners to keep to the rules.  


Let's say 60&amp;#37; of miners decide to change the rules. Let's say they're not after full destruction \- we'd be in a totally different ball game if that were so. They just want to change the rules to be more of an advantage to them. Let's say they double the block size, to give room for more tranactions. This is more or less like the Segwit2X scenario.

Now, a miner is a business. He has costs. He sells the coins \(block reward, fee\) he get to be able to pay that cost.  


If there were two competing chains, things get interesting. So let's say I run an exchange \- or sell coffee, it's the same, we're all part of the same economy. A miner sends a block that is too large to me. What will my node do? It'll reject the block. To \*me\*, it's worthless. Now, what's the value of the BTC in the block? It's what people are willing to give for it! What if miners change the rules, and \*no\* exchanges follow through? They'll not be able to sell their coins. All they can do is stash it on the blockcchain. It'd technically be valid, but if noone buys it, then it's worthless.  


Well, we still have 40&amp;#37; honest miners. Blocks will be slow for a while, that's for sure. But they're there, they can recoup their money. Fees will probably be sky\-high, so it'll be lucrative to stay honest.  


So, what's a non\-mining full node in this? It's a very useful tool! Without it, you trust someone else to do this choice for you! They might chose the 60&amp;#37; worthless coins, and if you were running a small business, you'd not want to sell your stuff for worthless coins?  


Now, of course \- if you are tricked in to taking the coins for goods, they aren't worthless. There's a limit how much you'll take, though, so it's not going to change things much \- \*unless\* a lot of others do as you. This is why it is important that people can run full node and indeed, that some do. They \*are\* a large part of the incentive for miners to stay honest.

2018-06-03,"&gt; I can't think of any other scenario. In all other cases, you get punished and it's going to be identical or better for the receiving side. Is this what you were talking about? Can you think of another scenario?

If channels are open indefinitely, one double spend (""fraud"" as they seem to call it in LN circles) of an old state will invalidate all further interactions on LN that depend on this state, directly or indirectly.

Now, fair enough, the entity committing fraud might not be *directly* incentivized in terms of monetary value on LN due to the punishment to do so.

But who said that's the goal? If you want to create havoc, just make sure the state you invalidated has been incorporated into as many HTLCs as possible - to rip up a whole set of transaction history.

At some point, the fair question to ask becomes: If everyone's using LN: Is the state of LN going to be what tells you who owns what - or is it going to be the Bitcoin chain, that thing no one cares about because it is just the new settlement layer running in some dusty attic on some raspberry pi?

And I think that's why the twitter thread is on point regarding the dangers of LN.

I have said before that I believe LN might be helpful for *micropayments*. Given the ever-increasing complexity, I am not so sure of even that anymore.

Yup.  But it's really easy to fake hysteria, especially in crypto. Which goes back to the idea of trust again. You can verify it happened with your full node.  Alternatively, if it did happen and you do see it in your node, you can help the community by yelling ""Fire!""  

&gt;If honest miners control 70% and choose to do this, they will quickly rewrite the fraudulent chain anyway, non-mining nodes don't impact this.

2018-06-03,"&gt; This would be really probematic and creates a bottleneck.  Full nodes aren't capable of sharing information an unlimited amount of times. 

In electrum case, it's just headers for verification, which is tiny. The vast majority of data exchange is with a single node.

&gt; But I am able to be notified if there is a reorg in the blockchain.  Therefore, I know the authenticity of the blockchain has been compromised.

I don't even use or care about BTG, but I was ""notified"" of the double spend when I opened any Crypto-related subreddit and news site. Though I agree that if I was running a full node and set up automatic alerts sent to my phone as email/SMS, I would have gotten notified earlier. But even if I wasn't - my funds are unaffected since I hold my own keys. If I was receiving a payment for a product, saw a confirmation, gave the product to buyer, and got double-spent via chain reorg afterwards, this notification doesn't help me - the funds are already gone and I could have been notified just as well by seeing them disappear from my wallet. 

&gt; 2. Let's say it's 1 miner who has 30&amp;amp;#37; of the hashrate.  Non\-mining full nodes \(with consensus of course\) can choose to reject that miner's blocks and agree to only accept blocks from the remaining 70&amp;amp;#37;.  This then censors that miner.

If honest miners control 70% and choose to do this, they will quickly rewrite the fraudulent chain anyway, non-mining nodes don't impact this. If it was the other way around and 30% were honest, you're creating a new protocol rule (for example, block X has to have this hash, since we know it was first), so that's just a hard-fork. In both cases non-mining nodes have no say. But let's say miners decide to take into account the opinion of node operators. How do they do that? Let's say I'm the attacker. I'll reorg the chain and spin up a few thousand full nodes beforehand. There's just one real node behind all of them, but they have different IPs across the whole world so are indistinguishable from real nodes from the outlook. This is relatively cheap to do. Now I will use thousands of fake social media accounts complete with [NoCensoring] tags by their names, that cry that doing this would compromise chains integrity. There seem to be more nodes agreeing to protect the attacker. How do the honest miners know which to follow? They don't. Unless they only listen to certain ""trusted"" nodes, which beats the point. Such consensus is impossible, which is precisely why Nakamoto Consensus based on proof of work is so important - it's unfakeable. "

Just settling in bitcoin is more than good enough. Furthermore, if he holds on to bitcoin, while he needs to settle with his own suppliers in fiat, he is running a serious currency exchange risk. Therefore, at this point in the evolution of bitcoin, he will still have to convert a large part of his bitcoin receipts to fiat. He can do that without dragging the fiat bankstering system into the fray by using stablecoins such as USDT, bitUSD, or trueUSD. All of this may improve in the future, but for now, we do not want bitcoin-accepting merchants to go bankrupt or have to charge uncompetitive, high margins, just to cover for the existing mismatch."

2018-06-03,"&gt;ASICs are not a significant cause of centralization of mining (a fatal flaw of all cryptocurrencies, including PoS ones). The causes are the many factors that make a large miner more profitable than two miners half its size, from economies of scale to better marketing and political clout; and the lack of any factor that would push the other way.

There are limitations to centralisation.

There only so much cheap electricity that be used localy without making its price rise and becoming unprofitable.

If you take the extreme example, it is impossible for one single farm to mine bitcoin because of that very problem. (It would become unprofitable and smallest mining farl will slowing eat its market share).

Even with subsidized electricity there is a limit how much can be taken cheaply out of the local network.

Some economy of scale will tend to reverse at very high scale.

I think cooling cost might see similar phenomenon at high scale too,

But let's just argue it is, for the sake of trying out what the solution to your problem would be. The liberal government in any country is against your cause because they want to force you at gun point to pay their taxes. They don't want you directly adding to costs that will impact their bottom line by directly getting rid of carbon. They won't let it happen. So you can't work with them, you have to go through them. 

And that is the ones that act like they are doing something. They are arguably doing more harm than the Republicans, if your theory is true, because the left will utterly and permanently destroy the publics trust in having any government organized solution to this problem. Take for example the liberals in Ontario right now, they did a bunch of green stuff and shut down some power plants etc. At this point they are so unpopular that they might be completely destroyed as a party, winning too few seats to even have party status, they've ruled that province for the last 15 years and now they will cease to exist. But think about how much damage they did to environmental issues in the publics' eyes. It's getting very near the point where the government will never to be able to do anything other than institute taxes at gun point. And TBH if crypto takes off, they are gonna have trouble collecting taxes :\
