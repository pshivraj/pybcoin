"Nope, central reserve banks are not legally allowed to provide lender of last resort coverage on anything except fiat they produce themselves or underwritten contracts based on that fiat. You will *never* see legal fractional reserve bitcoin banking. Maybe with a FED coin but anybody even commenting in this sub should already know that isn't really cryptocurrency. 

And FDIC is mandatory for any bank making loans based on customer reserves held in their custody or the custody of the central bank providing the (commercial bank) coverage. Since FDIC valued in crypto (not fiat) isn't possible, there thus cannot be a bitcoin fractional reserve of any sort whatsoever .",1527104504

"Yes it’s taxable. If you were on another exchange like gdax and sold some coins for BTC- that’s also taxable. 
People that buy and sell often use the data exhachanges keep But things get complicated when u think of the different exchanges one uses, wallets, shapeshifter, etc which is why I paid my taxes but deferred and got an extension to submit the info for them in the fall because I was very young and fresh last year. The taxes get bigger but you also make more gains unless you are planning to do a long term (1 year hold) on your coins. But if u buy eth at $40 and sell at $400 that’s $360 of profit that’s taxable. But if u bought at $40 sold at 95 bought at 85 sold at 230 bought at 200 and sold at 400 then you have $400 of profit. So if you’re paying %20 on your taxes by trading you’re only paying $8 more in taxes. But u made $40 totally to $32 more. On a large scale this is worth it if u do it well. But then at the end of the end year you’ll want to see where you end up to see where you fall in the tax brackets and if you’re just poking into a tax bracket then you’ll want to lose money or donate money or something to drop u down into a lower tax bracket.

From the time that Michael Goldstein saw my pull request to the time the quotes page was fix was 11 minutes. You can view all of this yourself on their GitHub repo for proof. https://github.com/NakamotoInstitute/nakamotoinstitute.org

You can also verify that the quotes were never taken down to begin with. There's another bug that allowed you to view e.g. /quotes/*/ which would render the page with no quotes searched using the regular template to verify that they didn't just change the template to display a fake error page.

You have to realize that if you provide information to investors that forecasts some level of expecation of a return, then they will be deemed a security by the SEC.  Information about the products revenue, information about how the product is doing in any regard, then this crypto would pass the Howey test and likely require SEC registration. 

We are seeing this more and more with other cryptos. They are no longer providing updates and they are real careful about what they convey because they need to be able to pass regulatory scrutiny.  

By definition, what you are requesting is exactly what an investor in a public stock would request, so just the fact that you are demanding this information is a sign that SALT could be deemed a security because you, as an investor, had expectations that the the SALT token would increase in value based on SALT's performance as a lending platform.

"A \- I disagree, and B \- Computer Networks happen to be my field of expertise, so let's not assume **I don't understand**, and instead assume we migh**t disagr**ee. I was able to discuss computer networks with a Turing Award winner, so I think I can manage a civil reddit discussion.

To your point, bloXroute has no hubs. If anything, it is similar to AT&amp;T, Comcast, and the other Internet infrastructure you are using today to send blocks. Only difference is that bloXroute is x1000 more efficient, **and** is provably neutral, which the others are not. So while they can do to you whatever they want \(imagine what happens to the connectivity if/when a war breaks between the US and China\), bloXroute doesn't know who you are, what you wish to send, and most importantly, you don't even have to interact with it directly.

To your point about being a single\-point\-of\-failure \- you are absolutely correct. This is indeed the doomsday worst case scenario that bloXroute had to solve, by making it *replaceable*. If bloXroute fails, blockchains and crypto must be able to continue their operation \(hot swap\) for 6 months or a year, before deciding what to replace bloXroute with permanently \(if bloXroute was indeed shut down permanently and not coming back\). This is why we open source everything we do and introduce the concept of backup networks, operated by any party, costing nothing \(and actually generating profit\).

As per Sybil attacks, they are mitigated using long sliding window bandwidth limitations \- you can send whatever you want \(including test\-blocks to audit bloXroute\), but you can't send too much. We are considering adding internal zero knowledge proof which will prove the validity of the PoW of a block, without revealing its content, but this is still being developed and awaits in\-depth peer review before we move to that path.

I have not envisioned any mesh networks, and in my analysis I consider the optimal scenario, where the network is a full graph, there is no congestion, there are no topologies inefficiencies, no messages are ever lost, and no overheads. Even then, if a block is x10 larger, the time it takes for one node to send it to another node increases by x10, the total time is x10 \(at best\), and the window of opportunity for forks to occur increases by x10. If you increase by x100, you will see a fork every block \(when blocks are full\).

If you want to know what really changed Bitcoin fundamentals, it was the relay networks which give you the illusion that everything is fine and there is no networking bottleneck, while in reality everyone has to place their trust in the relay networks, who can abuse/censor the network as they please, particularly for on\-chain scaling.",1527103670

"This statement is beyond ignorant. The crypto space holds billions of dollars, and the potential to free humanity. The first thing you learn in economics is that everything is economics. Every single thing is economics. What I eat for breakfast, whether i ride a bike or drive a car, whether I call someone, even things that don't seem connected are. 

Most people cannot see these connections. And the blocksize increase is an economic decision, and both parties had to decide what would be the effects on the ecosystem after such a change was implemented.

As for opinions, everyone can have an opinion about anything they want. That doesn't make them qualified to make decisions for billions of dollars of money. That is why we have consensus. 

Are you talking about your full node for BCH? The network barely has any transactions and the block sizes are less than 100kb every time I look, so it makes sense that it uses less than 1% of your domestic bandwith. 

If you are getting a 1gb block every 10 minute, we are talking over 500 terabytes a year. 

Obviously computers are going to increase in their effectiveness, and we will have other optimizations too.

There is nothing wrong if you have large data centers as mining farms. There is just a centralization risk that core wanted to avoid. I can see both sides of the argument.",1527103252
"&gt; As BTC is Bitcoin by consensus, it has many, many more talented devs working on the protocol and related projects. BCH may feel like its more useful but it is very much being left behind on a development front.

That's a good point I never thought of. It would be interesting to go through the dev team behind BTC and BCH and compare the two. Which team has the most experience? Maybe will save that for a later post.",1527103196

"&gt;&gt; Roger regularly refers to Bitcoin Cash as Bitcoin (BCH) which is misleading.
&gt;
&gt;Not misleading at all. Both forks are competing to be ""Bitcoin"". The (BCH) clearly distinguishes which coin it is.   

100% misleading. Those letters are called ticker symbols. A ticker symbol is a group of characters used to identify a specific security like a stock, ETF, mutual fund, or in this case cryptocurrency.    

BCH is the ticker symbol representing ""Bitcoin Cash"".  
BTC is the ticker symbol representing ""Bitcoin"".    

BCH is not the ticker symbol for Bitcoin.   
Using the wrong ticker symbol next to a cryptocurrency or security is not only confusing but also misleading.    



&gt;&gt; That's like referring to Bitcoin Gold as Bitcoin Cash (BTG)
&gt;
&gt;That doesn't make sense because BTG forked from Segshit coin (BTC) not BCH.   

Bitcoin Cash (BTG) has more of a right to call itself Bitcoin Cash than Bitcoin ABC (BCH) does.

"&gt;Locked in on-chain but if you can still use and send it, there's no problem.

You can *maybe* send it if there is anyone who sells something to you on the LN and you have enough money locked up. But in general you don't want to lock up money somewhere where you can potentially use it if something goes wrong.

&gt;I don't know the heuristic used by auto-pilot by I imagine it's something like ""connect to nodes with decent ping that have between X and Y open channels to other nodes"". Above X so that you don't connect to very useless nodes, below Y to not lead to mega-hubs automatically.

Which is most probably gonna lead to mega-hubs, anything else is less efficient.

&gt;ViaBTC is part of the same group.

What? That's not true at all.

&gt;As for the ""other"", besides what I already told you Antpool is way too small on BCH, the coin that Antpool's owner created, so the big ""other"" is likely mostly him.

Jihan did not create BCH, what are you even talking about? You cannot say that ""other"" is most likely him, that's just a completely baseless assumption.

"***TRADERS BEWARE***
Whales are now manipulating the volume for Bitcoin Cash in significant amounts on GDAX/Coinbase...though it doesn’t appear as evident with Bitcoin that they are doing the same thing. It looked like Christmas with flashing green and red numbers back and forth. This is different from buy and sell walls and I’ve never seen them do this before for Bitcoin Cash. A common gripe and pessimism among Bitcoin HODLers and day traders is the incredibly low volume. So, to address this issue, whales are manipulating the volume by buying 0.10000 increments of BCH to up the volume. Reason I bring up BCH is that they could do the same thing with Bitcoin. GDAX volume is currently 14,000 Bitcoin past 24 hours, which is twice the volume of yesterday’s 24 your volume. Volume has always been a manipulative variable, but not as manipulative as price. Plus, the cryptocurrency price was always the go-to thing to manipulate. Since the BCH fork was released, whales have been in complete deception mode, manipulating anything and everything they can to sway daytraders and inexperienced traders. The problem is deception mode always has a bad ending with Bitcoin hitting rock bottom prices. I’m curious if anybody else is seeing volume being manipulated at extraordinary levels on other exchanges. Tomorrow, we could see a 40K Bitcoin volume even though the whales 90-95% of the volume and the true volume being 2-3K. That’s why you should neglect volume at this point.

"People don't even understand what Warren Buffet was saying before throwing all kind of childish insults and calling him old and dumb. 

Warren Buffet described Bitcoin as gambling not investing.

\&gt;  

&gt;You aren’t investing when you do that. You’re speculating. There’s nothing wrong with it. If you wanna gamble somebody else will come along and pay more money tomorrow, that’s one kind of game. That is not investing.

As an investor \(and a safe, sound one at that\), he would not advise ""investing"" in crypto because he recognizes it's not a value appreciating asset. He advises against ALL speculation and has for a long time, yet people are quick to jump to the narrative that it's because he has a vendetta against bitcoin because he's scared banks will collapse or something. 

\&gt;  Because you are not really, you are counting on, for whatever factors, could be quarterly earnings, could be up or it's going to split or whatever it may be or increase the dividend, but you are not looking to the asset itself. 

That's a quote from 2011 before people even started asking him about Bitcoin. 

He didn't say it was impossible to make money off crypto. Even if the prices were to rise, he wouldn't be wrong. It IS a speculative market of people gambling, hoping the next person pays more than the price they paid for. All Buffet did was describe something that almost everyone except the die hard fanboys recognize that it is a bubble. Look at the prices of shitcoins and scamcoins mooning and collapsing all the time. 

Personal attacks of Buffet or pointing out that he wasn't 100&amp;#37; right about everything in the past are juvenile and irrelevant.

ViaBTC is part of the same group. As for the ""other"", besides what I already told you Ant pool is way to small on BCH, the coin that Antpool's owner created, so it's likely him. 

No way to prove, of course, but it doesn't matter, even if he doesn't have 50% is way too close and on-chain centralization is still worse than LN centralization, which is what we were arguing about.

Lets start here: if a capacity increase on the network (that would enable more participants/activity on the network and/or lower fees) would conclusively lead to (only) 1% of the current full nodes to opt to shut down, would that tradeoff ever be worth it?

There's a reason almost nobody knows what ZEC or NANO are outside of the crypto sphere. 

I've been in crypto for years now, and one thing has been consistent. Shitcoins die, and bitcoin survives. Why? Because its use case is its network effect. Alts are just a money grab. 90% of the projects could be established without the need of a token. Therefore, its speculation is purely based on the idea that owning this coin will net me a fortune if the team can continue to raise money with their centralized scam.

It is clear your bias is based on pure financial gain. You sold your bitcoin, now you're hoping your alt bet pays off. And not understanding bitcoins importance in the market has you suggesting ridiculous ideas. ""Hey guys, I have an idea that will make markets pump my bags, please!""",1527099792
"&gt; If your reference point is O'Hagan, then from memory this isn't right. His ex colleague built the nChain deal. As for willing - he needed the money, he had a financial crisis, so I would say it wasn't a free choice, more a forced one. And as for signing his life rights away, timing is important here, i.e. when he thought he would have to reveal. Should I assume you're backing down from the 'outing himself' claim?

I'm not claiming I have solid evidence that the 'leaks' were Craig's doing (though, again, since they contained the fake stuff he made, it's *likely* that he had something to do with it). However, he undoubtedly was the originator of the claims of being Satoshi, no matter how you try to spin it.

&gt; Why is the burden on me? You gave an estimate, I gave a lower one. Either way it doesn't really matter. Let's say there were 1,000 people with this much knowledge, do you see how this reduces the probability that this fraud could/ would be executed?

How do you know it's not 10,000 or 100,000? In fact, it could be even more. The question is *how many people* **could amass** *the 'knowledge' Craig has about bitcoin if they wanted to pretend to be Satoshi?* It's not how many people *had* the knowledge... 

&gt; Too late here for me to read another one of those threads.

Summary: Craig doesn't understand how bitcoin mining is a memoryless process. A technology he supposedly invented.

&gt; Go on, enlighten me.

It's a variant on the balance fallacy. Just because there are two options doesn't mean their probabilities are equal. 

&gt; It seems likely that most of the posting was done or filtered through DK

So they were time-delayed?

&gt; Type in ""Coin"" and select the suggested ""Coin"" from the autocomplete options. Repeat for Bit. Type in bitcoin.

This is 2018, and why would Bit and Coin be capitalized then?

&gt; You seem to have avoided my point about why he would take such an extraordinary risk of using O'Hagan.

You are again overestimating his ability to sniff out a fraud. This is not an empirical claim. We'll have to disagree, since there's nothing to back it up either way. 

&gt;  I'm going to guess you don't really know how auditing/ accounting / tax reviews work. Suffice it to say, people don't just rely on people's word. They need to see evidence. And that needs to be documented. That's how it works. You have one out here. That none of the accountants or ATO understood it enough to validate his balances. 

Again, if he had the 1.1m bitcoin, **it would have helped his case**. Why did they continue the case if he had the bitcoin?  Your argument doesn't make sense. 

&gt; The odd thing about it is the part about the wallet.dat - if his intention was to plant a seed about being the creator of bitcoin why would he include something that indicates he's trying to scam coins back?

I didn't get a 'scam back' vibe from the email. It looks like: ""Your son did something great! Look for a file you'll never find! Get on board the Dave and Craig are Satoshi train and you'll be rewarded!""

&gt; I'd say for something to be implausible there would have to be conclusive proof that CSW isn't Satoshi

Give *an example* of what you'd consider *conclusive*, please. I will proceed to shoot it down in a similar vein as what you're doing. 

&gt; So what odds are you offering? 100-1 based on your confidence? I presume not.

Well, since you seem to be on the opposite end of the spectrum, 100-1 wouldn't exactly be fair, especially given the risks involved with btc transfers. I'll DM you, though.

&gt; Yes, it was (locally) reported at the time of his house being raided. From memory there was a quote from someone from the electricity supplier and a neighbour validating the point.

I'll take your word for it, but it's incredibly poor evidence either way. There are many uses for upgraded electrical service. Again, he previously claimed to run a supercomputer.

&gt; I'm not a coder. From what I picked up, Craig wasn't doing the coding, someone else / others were.

LOL, he didn't make the posts, he didn't write the code, yet he was the *main part* of Satoshi, utterly *sans evidence*? Interesting...

&gt; Poker just a coincidence then?

As online betting would be a very obvious, natural use of a nascent online currency, I fail to see how this is even suggestive, let alone a significant coincidence. And I thought you just said Craig didn't code it... :)

&gt;  It isn't, and the subtly is lost on you.

Enlighten me, then. 

&gt; So, I have to ask, who do you think Satoshi is? Best guess?

Most likely guess: someone we've never heard of. Most likely guess among known members of the community: split between Hal Finney and Nick Szabo. However, they're both well under 20%.

&gt; Conclusive evidence.

What does that even look like? You create 8 channels? To whom? I also fail to see how creating 8 random channels helps you get sufficient money everywhere. You would have to lock in way more money than if you just had 1 channel.

"Here's a (rather rough) translation of the Chinese bits, taken from the Youtube's description:

&gt; Jack:
&gt; 
&gt; I would like to explain it in Chinese. 
&gt; About who is Satoshi Nakamoto, there is a very fair standard in our industry.
&gt; Bitcoin is based on Mathematics. We believe in math.
&gt; In fact, there is only one question you need answer, do you have the private key?
&gt; Everyone can be Satoshi Nakamoto, if you don’t have the private key.
&gt; I can tell everyone here, I’m Satoshi Nakamoto.
&gt; 
&gt; (Argument)
&gt; 
&gt; Jack: Good bye, faketoshi!
&gt; 
&gt; I was talking about the standard, all of a sudden, he was so pissed off. He told us to choose a side. Is this a normal person’s logic?
&gt; Okay, let me continue. 
&gt; All of us sit here can be Satoshi Nakamoto, because there is no way to prove you are not. No one can provide (Satoshi’s) private key. 
&gt; Before a private key can prove you are actually not the real Satoshi, everyone can say they are Satoshi Nakamoto.
&gt; That’s why I said, all of us can say ourselves is Satoshi.
&gt; It is really easy to prove you are Satoshi Nakamoto, you just need to show us your private key signature.
&gt; We are now using math to ensure our assets, so all of us should believe in (math), otherwise your money will be controlled by others. 
&gt; Why did we choose (to use) Bitcoin? Why don’t we choose fiat, or we invest some parts of our assets in digital currency?
&gt; The reason is we believe in math. Let’s do not rely too much on human nature, logic or emotion. 
&gt; What we need believe is, who has the private key, who then is Satoshi Nakamoto.
&gt; If you lose your private key, even though you are Satoshi Nakamoto, you have no evidence to prove you are Satoshi Nakamoto. 
&gt; 
&gt; Craig is a fake Satoshi, and he’s extremely rude. 
&gt; When he was talking, I respected him.
&gt; I was just talking about an industry standard, a matured standard to define who’s Satoshi Nakamoto. All of a sudden, he was so pissed, even told us to choose which side should we stand?
&gt; 
&gt; This is an insult to a democracy society. We are here attending this meeting, we should respect everyone’s opinions. Craig Wright is just a shame of our community. 
&gt; 
&gt; I was about to discuss this issue peacefully, he offended me again and again. He told us to choose a side yesterday, today he continued (to ask). He’s Australian, he’s a shame of Australians. He’s also a shame of our community. Thank you!﻿",1527098987

"Yes you can.

Jim puts 100 BTC in his Coinbase account. Coinbase knows he will only use about 10% on a daily basis. Thus, Coinbase will lend out up to 90 BTC.

The people receiving the money will spend the 90 BTC. The people who get the BTC will then put it into Coinbase. Coinbase knows that only 10% of it will be used, so they loan out 81 BTC.

... there is now 271 BTC, and no one notices because they only use 10% of their money on a daily basis.

Short of a ""Coinbase run"" (a bank run), off-chain ledgers can actually increase the supply of BTC.",1527098921
"I mean coins that aren't just money. Coins that represent a percentage of a hypothetical value of a market. 

If everyone wants bitcoin, the price goes up. Nobody wants bitcoin, the price goes down.

But if the coin represents ownership of a percentage of the bandwidth available on a blockchain, it means your coin isn't just money. If you sell it, you don't sell currency for another currency, but you sell your ownership of X amount of bandwidth. 

That means if nobody is willing to use it as a currency, it still has a use. It becomes cheaper for devs and they are more likely to buy some, making the price go up and making it interesting as a currency.",1527098906
"You seem to think that BTC will always be the base trading pair for all of the cryptosphere. How many DEX will use BTC as a base pair? How about atomic swaps? Cross-chain functionality? How many coins purchasable with fiat? How many ICO airdrops?

"&gt; Look at the latest BCH HF, ~20% of the network was left behind.

That's a bullshit media report that seems has fooled you too. ~20% of the nodes didn't upgrade, but they were old non-mining nodes. All the miners are mining on the new rules. Nobody lost money. It was not a contentious upgrade by any means. 

&gt; I don't want this to happen to Bitcoin, so fully support soft forks as upgrade mechanism. As much as possible.

Soft forks also create a new chain, as I explained earlier, so there's also the probability of ""the zombie chain"". The benefit of the SegWit soft fork was that **non-mining** nodes aren't forced to upgrade. But non-mining nodes don't mean much in Proof of **Work** anyway. 

&gt; Topics like changes to the consensus rules are, by definition, not about Bitcoin, and hence banned. 

I think you should really think about this one some more. Changes to the consensus rules have always been discussed on the forums. Where else, it's supposed to be a decentralized development. Blockstream has been discussing *a small increase* too. Just people that disagree with them have been censored. 

There was a problem, scaling, and so a discussion was needed. Well, one side of the discussion was censored away, so naturally, only the other remained - off-chain solutions. How is relying on off-chain solutions more Bitcoin than letting it scale through bigger blocks, as intended [since it's creation](ssh://please-ask-me-about-this-one_its-obvious_Ill-explain)? 

&gt;  If you now add a few special rules (no discussion of ""censorship"" and no promotion of BCH... I think you'll agree that's for obvious reasons) you have the r-bitcoin moderation policy.

""No discussion of anything Blockstream dislikes"" is my definition of the r/bitcoin's policy. They have no problem having most their top post about BCH and LTC when it fits their narrative (BCH hate and LTC love). 

&gt; ""everything else"": I think you're probably referring to the push back seen lately against BCH. Someone put this very nicely - This is Bitcoin's 'immune system' getting activated. It's a natural reaction to all the confusion about Bitcoin that has been promoted lately. Even Mike Novogratz thought it necessary to chime in.

&gt; I don't think that's censorship, that's people protecting what they hold dear. Possibly playing dirty. But as they say, all's fair in love and war...

I take this as the fruit of the censorship. Manipulating the community for 3 years will inevitably brainwash them. You can clearly see it when they are not even making sense. Blockstream changed it's narrative so often that their explanation of their actions are not logical anymore, but people that have spent long time on the censored forums just blindly follow anything they're told there. 
",1527098623

And as for signing his life rights away, timing is important here, i.e. when he thought he would have to reveal.  Should I assume you're backing down from the 'outing himself' claim?

&gt;The burden is on you, and you haven't given anything to support it.

Why is the burden on me?  You gave an estimate, I gave a lower one.  Either way it doesn't really matter.  Let's say there were 1,000 people with this much knowledge, do you see how this reduces the probability that this fraud could/ would be executed?

&gt;Nope, wrong bet

Too late here for me to read another one of those threads.

&gt;I hope you know why this is a bad argument.

Go on, enlighten me.

&gt;No, his post time distribution suggests a single person living in the US

It seems likely that most of the posting was done or filtered through DK

&gt;You made the claim that it was potentially autocorrect, so the burden is on you to substantiate that

Type in ""Coin"" and select the suggested ""Coin"" from the autocomplete options.  Repeat for Bit.  Type in bitcoin.

&gt;I'm not sure if I've ever seen a text from Craig that had no mistakes, let alone many thousands of words. This would be remarkable.

If I could be bothered, I'd find some stuff to refute this.  But I can't.

&gt;The Tulip Trust is fake. The PGP keys were backdated. Do you dispute that?

I do not dispute the keys were backdated.  It remains to be seen if the trust is fake or not.  We have a timeline on that at least.

&gt;Again, I admitted that it's possible but highly unlikely, and gave reasons for that. It is hardly the best piece of evidence, but it is completely consistent with him being a fraud, and inconsistent with him being Satoshi.

I will grant you that it does look a bit odd.  But then Craig is a bit odd.  

&gt;Some agreement, though Craig (and other conmen) know that they don't have to fool everyone. Indeed, I'd say most of the crypto community didn't take his bait, but enough did for him to carve out a niche for himself. Even O'Hagan himself is still fairly ambivalent.

I think O'Hagan isn't ambivalent about Craig being Satoshi.  Read between the lines, watch other interviews he's given after.  He believes it's Craig but doesn't want to be so blunt about it.  His article explains this better than I did towards the end.

You seem to have avoided my point about why he would take such an extraordinary risk of using O'Hagan.  Think about it this way, if O'Hagan had sussed his scam after say a few months of work on it, he's going to write an article roasting the fraudster.  End of game for CSW.  So why would he take this risk?  The selection of O'Hagan was not chance.  

&gt;Ok, I'll clarify. There's no publicly available evidence. However, why would they need to establish that he actually possessed the 1.1m btc? They don't need that to make their case against him. In fact, it would weaken their case.

I'm struggling how to put this without coming across as condescending.  I'm going to guess you don't really know how auditing/ accounting / tax reviews work.  Suffice it to say, people don't just rely on people's word.  They need to see evidence.  And that needs to be documented.  That's how it works.  You have one out here.  That none of the accountants or ATO understood it enough to validate his balances.  But that still remains difficult to rationalise because CSW would be exposing himself (at a time of huge financial stress) to further financial pressure.

&gt;Unless he's a tax cheat, so what?

I never said I didn't think he's a tax avoider.  But the point is more he was in financial strife and this would take him in the wrong direction 

&gt;I don't see why you think this is so unbelievable. If I were going to involve my dead friend, I'd try to plant some seeds with his family first. Nothing odd about it.

The odd thing about it is the part about the wallet.dat  - if his intention was to plant a seed about being the creator of bitcoin why would he include something that indicates he's trying to scam coins back?

&gt;There are infinite 'possibilities', but only one that is plausible.

I'd say for something to be implausible there would have to be conclusive proof that CSW isn't Satoshi, which you haven't presented.

&gt;Well over 99%. I'm willing to back that up with a bet, if you're interested.

So what odds are you offering?  100-1 based on your confidence?  I presume not.  But I am interested in a bet.  Timescales would be the tricky part. 2020 is the obvious deadline with the Tulip trust, but that is a bit of a long term bet.  Not to come across as trying to be baller here, but I would be wanting to do something in size for it to be worth my while.  Let me know if interested and what odds, but let's do that DM pls.

&gt;He claims to have run a supercomputer as well. Do you have evidence for this 'industrial level electricity'?

Yes, it was (locally) reported at the time of his house being raided.  From memory there was a quote from someone from the electricity supplier and a neighbour validating the point.

&gt;This is much less compelling than the fact that there's zero evidence that Craig could code C++ at all during that period (despite highly detailed resumes available), much less at a level indicative of a professional. Even Craig's pseudocode is buggy. See figures 2 and 10.

I'm not a coder.  From what I picked up, Craig wasn't doing the coding, someone else / others were.

Poker just a coincidence then?

&gt;This is like saying an American would have chosen an American pseudonym...

It isn't, and the subtly is lost on you.

&gt;Utterly shocked, honestly. Like if aliens invaded tomorrow.

Wow, you put these at equivalent probabilities.  I'm looking forward to seeing what odds you offer me.  So, I have to ask, who do you think Satoshi is?  Best guess?

&gt;You might enjoy this conversation, then.

Thanks, I'll have a read tomorrow, it's late here.

&gt;What would convince you that he's a fraud?

Conclusive evidence.

"I won't lie, I am a huge following of this project and after being interested and involved in Bitcoin, etc since early 2013, there hasn't been a project I've been as excited about than this one. Not only does the goals of the project seem so grand and huge, I have grown a massive amount of respect for the honesty, professionalism and technical expertise of David Irvine and his team, but also of many of the members on their main forum: https://safenetforum.org/ 

The the community is so good, that some of them understand the code so well that they often answer questions on the forum just as well as the actually Maidsafe team can and have written an excellent Safe Network Primer: https://www.safenetworkprimer.com/

Not to mention in the past the community have run their own test nets and found bugs. For me this kind of community with a deep understanding of the tech with a passion for the project and working hard to develop on top of the platform is a key indicator of a very good project that has a massive potential for success. 

This project has been going on for over ten years (pre Bitcoin) and is so complex that when it finally arrives it will really turn some heads, with the fact it doesn't use a blockchain, so will solve the scaling issue, and that it is going to have instant use cases, with many apps and websites already created before we even hit full launch. 

If you don't know about this project, I strongly advise to do your research on it, as you will not find many projects with such a huge goal, plus amazing team and awesome community.

3. Profit

The “question mark” being anything that increases the value of Bitcoin Cash, whether that’s working with Lokad on the Terab Project(scaling to 1TB blocks) or investing in wallet software(Centbee, Handcash), helps them because if the value of BCH goes up, they profit.

"&gt;&gt; Take software from 2014 and let it spin up. It will sync on the Bitcoin network.
&gt;
&gt;But it won't be able to mine. This argument doesn't mean anything. Bitcoin was always supposed to keep being upgraded through hard forks.

It means a lot, actually. But on HFs, this might be true when there's a few geeks involved, not with global infrastructure being built on top. Look at the latest BCH HF, ~20% of the network was left behind. And that's with a lot less infrastructure behind it than BTC. HFs are not ""bad"" on their own, they just increase the probability that something goes wrong. And... it opens an additional attack surface - Resurrecting the zombie chain. And this also happened to BCH. I don't want this to happen to Bitcoin, so fully support soft forks as upgrade mechanism. As much as possible.

&gt;I didn't mean in numbers but in hash power. You'll say ""No way"", but what I mean is, miners mine what's profitable. They don't mine BTC because they support it, but because it pays the bills. 

Agreed 100%.


&gt;&gt; You can convince yourself there's ""censorship"", conspiracies and what have you.
&gt;
&gt;You can't say there's no censorship though. It's everywhere, recently on twitter too. Pro BCH opinions are being censored! Free discussions are being censored. 


There are two sides to this. One is r-bitcoin, the rest is ""everything else"".

r-bitcoin: If you go to a NASA summit on global warming, and someone started shouting that it's not real, or not human induced, would you be surprised if they got kicked out? And would you call that censorship? I think you wouldn't. Likewise in r-bitcoin the topic of conversation is Bitcoin, and nothing else. Topics like changes to the consensus rules are, by definition, not about Bitcoin, and hence banned. That's not censorship, just enticing moderation policy. If you now add a few special rules (no discussion of ""censorship"" and no promotion of BCH... I think you'll agree that's for obvious reasons) you have the r-bitcoin moderation policy.

And I can reassure you I've had my fair share of posts removed. I just understood there was a rule I was breaking, no hard feelings. 

""everything else"": I think you're probably referring to the push back seen lately against BCH. Someone put this very nicely - This is Bitcoin's 'immune system' getting activated. It's a natural reaction to all the confusion about Bitcoin that has been promoted lately. Even Mike Novogratz thought it necessary to chime in. 

I don't think that's censorship, that's people protecting what they hold dear. Possibly playing dirty. But as they say, all's fair in love and war... And if you're honest, you can't say BCH's most vocal/known proponents have been playing completely clean. I mean, this community called Roger out for the price pump before the Alex Jones interview! And in history only two people I'm aware of would offer the other cheek, Jesus and Gandhi.

"&gt; look how long it took mainstream tech changes

I think you haven't looked at the math closely enough. A lot of people think a BTC at $1M is a high price, it's ""the moon"" and a price at full adoption. This is totally wrong. BTC has basically zero adoption right now and price exploded to $10k+. 99% of people own zero BTC and the 1% who do own it have extremely limited use for it. Mainly it's for hodling or trading, trying to play the volatility markets.

When BTC captures an industry, it doesn't really matter what it is, when it dominates any industry as THE way to trade, value will skyrocket. That skyrocket will self-perpetuate another cycle of boom and bust, but the settling point will be far higher than today's prices. When we go from 1% of people owning bitcoin to 5% it will be a major move in price, easily to $100k and beyond.

Every halving exacerbates this. We will have industries dominated by BTC by end of 2019 if not before. BTC will become the new world reserve currency and will replace fiat in most of the world.

When you think about the volume of money that moves around, and BTC is going to have to account for a substantial portion of that flow, $1,000,000,000 is not at all unrealistic and it will be here before we know it. The adoption rate of new technology is accelerating. Sure, your cherry-picked example of chip+pin took X years to adopt globally but that technology was not opt-in on an individual level. BTC is. Hold on to your BTC because 5 years from now, you'd be kicking yourself for selling today at $100k.",1527096566

"The whole beauty of crypto over cash is that it's decentralized - no one entity owns it. It's equally valid in China as it is in the United States as it is in Africa as it is in Australia. It's a true worldwide currency that functions independent of any central bank or governing entity. Supply and transactions are carried out by miners, the coin is essentially backed by computational power.

Ripple, however, is privately owned. Created for banks. It's not minable and as such, the supply and value is created only by market scarcity. It's what I like to call, a ""nothing"" coin. It's not backed by anything but itself. I see it as an entity with the volatility of crypto and the usefulness of cash. It really just takes fiat currency and converts it to a coin just to get the 'crypto' buzzword. Contrast what makes cryptocurrencies so beautiful with XRP and you'll see why I have a deep rooted hatred for it. ",1527096544

"TRUST of people. Not just bitcoin, everything is valuable because people believe so. It can be by force (fiat money) or by common a belief within community (bitcoin). Suppose NASA airdropped you to the moon with 1 billion dollars or even with all of 21 million bitcoins, what can you do? Absolutely nothing. Because there is no one there who believes in your systems. Let's talk about our planet. If you go to a foreign country you get your money converted to local currency. Simply because majority of the population will only trade with you if show them the money they believe in. And if you are from a country like Zimbabwe or Venezuela, then good luck in trying to convert that money. It's all about a common trust people build on making things valuable so they can be used as a medium of exchange for our trades.

Now Bitcoin is valued because people trust it's a scarce, decentralized, immutable system but who decides current value? That is simply a supply/demand game. Anything which is scarce (Bitcoin/Gold), will appreciate in price if more people want it. Because there is only a fixed number that is available and people are willing to pay more to get hold of it. Anything which is not scarce and can be created anytime (Fiat money) will keep losing it's value.

https://twitter.com/ProfFaustus/status/998436165412966402

I am always amused coming here, Wright is one of the few that gets what Bitcoin is about: Global trade everywhere 24/7 giving everyone an equal opportunity to earn. It is capital at its finest - it is how capitalism should have worked from the beginning, not this crony capitalism with backdoor deals we have these days where the rich keep getting the only good deals. 

Wright gets that better than almost anyone I have seen over the years talk about Bitcoin, maybe even better than Ver. I also get why they pump BCH. It's definitely a complicated and loaded question, whether BTC or BCH is the currency play. In my opinion, the market has spoken on this already but who knows what the market decides tomorrow.

"&gt;the Lighning Network has its nodes already orders of magnitude more decentralized than bcash  

That's simply not true.  You started your argument off talking about transactions not nodes.  Anyhow nodes, as defined by Satoshi are miners--not verification nodes.  Verfication nodes are nothing more than a Ripple scam so your ""decentralization"" isn't really at all.  In fact, with miners now pooling resources for bitcoin cash development, bitcoin core is in serious trouble.  

Anyhow as I've said, no one is using Lightning.  The vast majority of nodes are very likely Blockstream fronts.  It's very easy to pay people to run a node.  The transactions are what matters and it's a simple case of not even being used.  Who cares if a node is up if no payments are going through it?  Deal with it.  

Now as to the possibility that peopel do start using Lightning after first acquiring bitcoin then setting up a payment channel with someone and finally actually using bitcoin, I say good.  I have just as much bitcoin as bitcoin cash.  I'd actually be objectively happy.  I just don't see it happening--ever.

A couple of comments from me:

1. The Lightning Network would be pretty cool if it works as advertised and it doesn't [recreate the banks](https://d.tube/#!/v/deobrands/d61ah8b1), but if it does work, it will be used on top of many cryptocurrencies, including BCH, so this is not a good reason choose BTC. 
2. On why biggers blocks don't bring centralization: Not only that tech like storage and bandwidth improves exponentially, thus running full nodes is cheaper, we BCH supporters also claim that it's not rational for everyone to run a full node. Unless you are a merchant or a hobbyist, SPV is all you need to be secure. 
3. The biggest problem with BTC is not it's scaling, it's the censorship and manipulation over the community. From 2008 till about 2015, everyone knew how Bitcoin will scale. It was in the whitepaper, Satoshi made it clear in many of his emails, the community was united. Then a vocal minority working for the company BlockStream got a hold of the moderation of all Bitcoin forums - r/bitcoin, bitcointalk.org, bitcoin.org and silenced anyone that didn't agree with their agenda: ""Bitcoin can't scale"".

"&gt; But you said he outed himself

Did he willingly sign away his 'life rights' or not? That's the important question.

&gt; The evidence is in the post. I suggested my estimate. What would you like, a receipt? Or perhaps you can show me your evidence the number is higher?

The burden is on you, and you haven't given anything to support it. 

&gt; A whole lot of fuss because he said a negative gamma when meaning something else.

Nope, wrong bet. [See here](http://archive.is/6C3C9).

&gt; And there is no evidence that there wasn't a team, so perhaps at best you could argue either was equally likely. 

I hope you know why this is a bad argument. 

&gt; Except if you consider what was involved from Satoshi's side I would estimate it more likely it were a team.

No, his post time distribution suggests a single person, and the code could absolutely be done by one person (I speak as a professional). 

&gt; How do you know that?

You made the claim that it was potentially autocorrect, so the burden is on you to substantiate that. It's highly unlikely, since 'Bit Coin' was never an accepted way of spelling Bitcoin, and I doubt it would have been in any autocomplete dictionary back then.

&gt; For me it's too insignificant to imply anything. Perhaps Craig was extra cautious about what he typed as Satoshi, fearing he may reveal himself with his language/errors?

I'm not sure if I've *ever* seen a text from Craig that had no mistakes, let alone many thousands of words. This would be *remarkable*. Also consider that Craig lived in Australia during the Satoshi period, and Satoshi's post timestamp distribution is utterly inconsistent with someone living there. Yes, he could have written mostly in the dead middle of the night and almost never in the early afternoon, but that's *highly implausible* and yet another hurdle that you have to tell a story to get around. 

&gt; Maybe he didn't want to access the satoshi wallets? Maybe he couldn't (Tulip trust)? 

The Tulip Trust is fake. The PGP keys were backdated. Do you dispute that?

&gt; Maybe he was mucking about with trading? Maybe there was another reason that didn't pop into my head?

Again, I admitted that it's *possible but highly unlikely*, and gave reasons for that. It is hardly the best piece of evidence, but it is completely consistent with him being a fraud, and inconsistent with him being Satoshi. 

&gt; he had conman balls of steel

Some agreement, though Craig (and other conmen) know that they don't have to fool *everyone*. Indeed, I'd say *most* of the crypto community didn't take his bait, but enough did for him to carve out a niche for himself. Even O'Hagan himself is still fairly ambivalent. 

&gt; OK this is going to sound a bit silly, but where's your evidence that there's no evidence with the ATO, KPMG, EY? As far as I am aware this is not public information. What I do know is that if you have an accountant representing you (especially from two big 4 firms as he had) then they would be managing their own risk by doing due diligence. EY were his internal audit.

Ok, I'll clarify. There's no publicly available evidence. However, why would they *need to establish that he actually possessed the 1.1m btc*? They don't need that to make their case against him. In fact, it would weaken their case. 

&gt; In the world of tax liabilities, that's a tax liability.

Unless he's a tax cheat, so what?

&gt; So you are saying that it's plausible that he premeditated this several years before with his best friend's 94 year old dad who had lost his son but then never used this himself, just hoped it would come out.

I believe they interviewed members of the Kleiman family back in 2015 or so, or at least Craig plausibly believed they would, since the 'leak' pointed to Dave. So this is totally consistent with what Craig 'should have done' to enact the fraud. I don't see why you think this is so unbelievable. If I were going to involve my dead friend, I'd try to plant some seeds with his family first. Nothing odd about it.

&gt; Yes, clearly first level thinking leads you to conclude HE'S A SCAMMER!! Second level thinking is he could be a scammer or he could have a reason to leave some doubt/ wriggle room if he ends up in court related to Silk Road. Both are possibilities.

There are infinite 'possibilities', but only one that is plausible.

&gt; I ask you this - what level of confidence do you have that CSW was not part of Satoshi? As a %

Well over 99%. I'm willing to back that up with a bet, if you're interested. 

&gt; I also ask you why, if he was not mining heavily in the early days, did his house (in a residential suburb) have industrial level electricity being pumped into it?

He claims to have run a supercomputer as well. Do you have evidence for this 'industrial level electricity'?

&gt; How about the 'coincidence' that early versions of the bitcoin client had poker op codes in it? (Given CSW's history of working with poker sites and on the money transfer problems they were having)

This is much less compelling than the fact that there's zero evidence that Craig could code C++ *at all* during that period (despite highly detailed resumes available), much less at a level indicative of a professional. Even Craig's [pseudocode is buggy](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3160279). See figures 2 and 10.

&gt; There are so many other things. All circumstantial. Like the choice of the The Times headline for the first block - an american would have chosen an american paper. The Times is exactly the sort of choice CSW would have made.

This is like saying an American would have chosen an American pseudonym...

&gt; If conclusive evidence did emerge to validate CSW how would you feel?

Utterly shocked, honestly. Like if aliens invaded tomorrow. 

&gt; I'm enjoying this discussion, I wanted to thrash this out for some time. I really want to learn how people like you can be so convinced that it's not him.

You might enjoy [this conversation](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/80jzhm/kleiman_v_craig_wright_the_bitcoins_that_never/duzqkag/), then.

The problem is every other fork of bitcoin is under $50 and failing, so why shouldn’t history repeat itself for BCH. Even with such great innovation: Memo for example, or a hard split without any dramas the price and value is still tied to BTC and still dropping.

"Haha, sounds like someone is getting a little emotionally invested in this discourse.

I'm 50. Already said that.

Well, you're right. 200K today is worth 200K last year and will be worth 200K in a hundred years. Just like 1 bitcoin today is worth one bitcoin 5 years ago and worth one bitcoin 5 years from now. The point is, if I can break this down to ELI5 for you, the stuff you can buy with 200k today is less than the stuff you could have bought with 200k last year. Fact. I'm betting on (along with an enormous group of other bitcoin holders, and for good reason) that bitcoin will be able to buy a lot MORE in a few years than it will buy today.

&gt; Had my view of the world been as wonderfully lucid and as wide as yours and I had put that on my ledger and stuck it in my drawer, it would be worth 60% less. My savings would currently be $80k.

Depends when you bought that bitcoin. Its value in USD is extremely volatile right now so yeah, If you bought mid-December 2017, you'd be down about 60% right now. But just try and have a bit longer of an outlook. 6 months is anyone's guess, but the farther out you look, the more optimistic the value of bitcoin becomes. 

&gt; Based on what? Your own speculation or just blind hope?

Based on a solid understanding of how revolutionary the technology is. It is a deflationary asset. It offers a tremendous advantage to disenfranchised people all over the world. So broad adoption will happen eventually. As long as it remains highly volatile it's use as a currency is limited. Even if it remained primarily a store-of-value it'd be as good as gold. But it's actually better than gold. You can't spend gold the way you spend cash. You can't email gold to someone. You can't store or transport gold safely and securely without great effort and expense. 

Please show me your research that people are overwhelmingly less willing to take responsibility for the security of their own wealth. Just because people primarily keep their money in banks right now doesn't mean they will prefer to keep their money in banks when cryptocurrency is well established in their economy.",1527092843

I'll use Chinese for this - with regards to Satoshi's identity, actually we have a very reasonable standard. Bitcoin was created on mathematical concepts, let's believe the math. If you are Satoshi, there's only one way to prove it, do you have his private key? Without the key, we are all Satoshi. Today I can say as well, that I am Satoshi...""

- altercation here - 

I was just talking about our standard, but he got angry instead. He wants us to pick a side, can you call this rational thinking?

Right, let's continue. Everyone here today is Satoshi, because there's no way to prove you aren't him either, there's no private key. Until the private key proves you aren't Satoshi, we are all Satoshi. If you want to prove you are Satoshi, it's simple. Just sign with your private key. 

We are using maths to protect our property. What we need is faith in this idea, or your money will be under the control of others. Why do we choose bitcoin? Why not other cryptocurrencies, or rather, just partly in other cryptocurrencies? Because we believe in the maths. Don't put your faith in human nature and sensibilities, just believe in one thing - as long as we have the key, we are satoshi. If you lost the key, even if you were satoshi, you wouldn't be able to prove it. Some &lt;inaudible&gt; you have to challenge, with logic and rationality. Craig is a fake Satoshi, and extremely rude too. While he was speaking, I respected him. I just wanted to propose a mature, accepted standard for our industry, to establish whether someone really is Satoshi. However he was so rude, and even wanted us to pick a side. Do you guys really want to pick a side? What if Taiwan only had a single political party? This is an insult to our democratic society. How did we get to the point where we are meeting up today? It's because we respected everyone's freedom of speech. Craig is a disgrace upon this community. I just wanted to have a peaceful discussion, and yet he, over and over again - he did the same yesterday at the closed-door meeting - he wanted us to pick a side, ""Either he goes or I go"" and he continued to do so today.

"Google Translate:
All 33 employees of the digital trading platform BTC Direct will receive a part of their salary in bitcoin from next month. Unique in the Netherlands, claims the company that buys and sells bitcoins on behalf of its customers.
You just have to take a look at the course of the bitcoin to see how erratic the price trend is. On the 6th of May, 1 bitcoin scored just under 10,000 dollars, now the digital currency is under 8000 dollars.
With a bit of bad luck, the crypto investor lost part of his deposit next day. BTC Direct employees know the whip and are not awake. Not even if some of their own hard-earned money will evaporate.
The employees received an e-mail a few months ago asking whether they wanted to receive part of their salary in bitcoins and if so, for what amount. The result: everyone wanted to participate and on average for an amount of 100 euros per month. The minimum amount is 20 euros and the highest 500 euros.
There was no question of peer pressure, spokesman Jerrymie Marcus of the trading platform emphasizes. ""To be honest, only enthusiasts who also act from idealism work here.""
It is not surprising that the plan does not come from the management, but from employees. One of those people is 33-year-old Roy Spies. He has studied leisure management and has been working at BTC Direct for a year at the customer contact department.
,, I buy a few hundred euros of cryptocurrency every month. I find it convenient that this will automatically be done later. And it saves me transaction costs of 2 percent, ""says the employee from Tiel. He has opted for a monthly amount of 300 euros. According to the current price, that would be 0.043 bitcoin. ,, I admit: that may sound very little, but all in all it is a nice amount. ''
Despite his enthusiasm, he does see a few downsides. One is that BTC Direct purchases at a fixed time in the month. That may be just at a time when the price is unfavorable. ""But on the other hand, it can also be just at a favorable moment,"" he adds.
Another disadvantage, he thinks, is that BTC Direct only pays out in bitcoin. ,, In addition to bitcoin, I also have other digital coins such as ether and litecoin. I would also have liked to choose another digital currency. ''
Spies thinks that his boss does this very well. He believes that the bitcoin will be around 100,000 euros by 2020 and will become an accepted payment method worldwide. ,, Then it is nice that I already get paid a part in bitcoin. ''
In the Netherlands, BTC Direct seems to be the first company that gives employees bitcoins. Dutch law does have one restriction: an employer must pay at least the minimum wage in euros. Anything that exceeds that amount may be paid in bitcoin. In Germany and Japan there are also companies that pay their employees bitcoin. Meanwhile, more than half a million Dutch people have bitcoin or other cryptocurrency.",1527092393

"I wouldn't listen to that comment, just because he lacks an understanding of why Mt. Gox related Due Diligence is essentially worthless, either for or against bitcoin. 

Mt. Gox is likely going to sell their bitcoin on a darkpool, peer to peer style. Because it never hits the order books, the price of bitcoin will not change because of this transaction. The reason this is likely is because they have an obligation (and incentive) to get the best price possible for their holdings. 

In other words, if people downvote this post, it probably isn't because they are mad or upset. It's probably because your op relies on assumptions made that aren't realistic (that bitcoins from Mt. Gox will be sold on exchanges), and thus doesn't prove anything.",1527092282
"Hi, i think i got some ideas. Let's see. The time: a utopic/distopic future. The place: planet earth. The characters: People from two different countries (or maybe two half of the planet, like today, the world have 2 different political and economical pov, maybe 3) 
In one, lets call it Happyland, BCH is the actual currency, and that has empowered people, and they just become smarter, and make progress in tecnology, medicine, science, politics. Has less violence (virtually 0 violence) everyone is free, and love and treat with respect each other. Economics become a way to keep everyone wealthy, and they do help each other out when in need. There is not rich neither poor. They all live with all the luxury (wich has become natural) and enjoy a great society.
In the other hand, Sadland (you gotta pick better names haha) is the opposite. They just keep FIAT or choose another cryptocurrency (not gonna choose one, could be anything, even a fake one, like Sadcoin) that is not a cryptocurrency at all, It is just controlled by the goverment, who is the only one who can trade it, sell it and mine it. Of course, people from the goverment are pretty rich, but everyone else is poor and sad. No one knows the actual price of anything, cause it fluctuates so bad due to inflation and gov control and manipulation, that people just does not buy anymore. They just live with the food the gov give them, and do what the gov says. BCH is illegal of course, and so is the internet. There is a bunch of brave man who try to fight the opression from the shadows, and try to give people some happiness, but are in clear disadvantages. And of course, they can't leave the country (i can go on in the characteristics of both countries, especially the 2nd one, but i think you got the idea already)
I mean, this is not the history. This is the context for several stories to happen. One about the resistance in sadland fighting the man. One about a little kid learning about BCH in happiland. One about some romantic girl in happiland how fall in love with a rebel from sadland how talk to her thru the illegal internet connection they have, and how imposible is their love. One about great technologic innovations in happiland. One about a 17 yo guy who get in prison because of fight for justice. I mean, you can write a lot from here (if you find this interesting) 
Remember i say maybe a 3rd country? Maybe there is an island where they adopted dogecoin (or some funny crypto) and they are all poor but fat and really happy, and live in harmony with the nature, and eat from her, and stuff. Or maybe there is dogs who evolved due to technology in happiland and become pretty smart (i mean, for a dog, they are like a 6 yo and can talk) and they decide to move to that island and make his own country, Dogeland haha. I don't know.
Btw, i'm kinda of a amateur cartoonist (i had publish some of my draws in here, i can make more realistic stuff though) So if you write some history, and want to get it ilustrated, just let me now (free of charge, just the credit for the draws)

"&gt; I was talking about his claim of being Satoshi. He willingly 'gave it up'.

But you said he outed himself, which there is no evidence for, but I guess circumstantial is OK when it supports your argument.  And he was hardly ""willing"" as you described.  Watch the videos again.  

&gt;Evidence?

The evidence is in the post.  I suggested my estimate.  What would you like, a receipt?  Or perhaps you can show me your evidence the number is higher?

&gt;See his bet with Peter Rizun.

I have.  A whole lot of fuss because he said a negative gamma when meaning something else.  This demonstrates the level of scrutiny he's under and there are relatively few of these controversies. 

&gt;Right, but 1) there's no evidence for a team, and 2) there's no evidence that they 'switched roles', and 3) this is special pleading.

And there is no evidence that there wasn't a team, so perhaps at best you could argue either was equally likely.  Except if you consider what was involved from Satoshi's side I would estimate it more likely it were a team.  

&gt;Sure, but it wouldn't capitalize **that**.

How do you **know** that?

&gt;And the real Satoshi made nary a mistake. Doesn't that imply Craig never was 'that role'?

For me it's too insignificant to imply anything.  Perhaps Craig was extra cautious about what he typed as Satoshi, fearing he may reveal himself with his language/errors?

&gt;Craig supposedly had access to 1 million+ bitcoins. For someone like that to be actively trading fewer than 50 is unlikely, but not impossible.

Maybe he didn't want to access the satoshi wallets?  Maybe he couldn't (Tulip trust)? Maybe he was trading for someone else?  Maybe he was mucking about with trading? Maybe there was another reason that didn't pop into my head?

&gt;HAHAHAHA! Seriously?! Are we talking about the same Craig here? The blatant plagiarizer? Come on...

You don't understand him.  Watch his latest video, from coingeek.  It's a small example but during that he calls out his team and references their support.  He doesn't make a big deal of it but he does it.  I've seen this from him a few times.  I've worked with plenty of people who take all the credit and Craig is not one of those.

&gt;Correct. Have you read The Lord of the Rings and think it's a true story?

Yes and no.  Although it is pretty reflective of real life . . .

&gt;Your evidence that Craig is Satoshi is that a journalist got that impression?

No, because it's not as simple of having one piece of evidence, like a crypto signature.  My point is that another hurdle CSW would have to overcome would be to trick a sharp mind.  Not only by himself, but relying upon all those around him.  This would be an extreme risk that could simply be avoided by going with a lightweight journalist.  Either he was real or he had conman balls of steel. The fact that he would have to rely on others around him suggests to me if he was a fraud he would not have taken this risk.

&gt;No, there's no evidence that he actually possessed the 1.1m bitcoins. The issue was that he claimed R&amp;D tax credits that he wasn't entitled to. To support that, he claimed ownership of the bitcoin. There was no evidence, though.

OK this is going to sound a bit silly, but where's your evidence that there's no evidence with the ATO, KPMG, EY?  As far as I am aware this is not public information.  What I do know is that if you have an accountant representing you (especially from two big 4 firms as he had) then they would be managing their own risk by doing due diligence.  EY were his internal audit.  KPMG were his tax advisors.  I'm not sure who did his external audit but I presume there was a third accounting firm too.  All three of these parties would have seen evidence of balances.  As would the ATO.  And these papers have been submitted by lawyers in the suit against him so there's further support that this is more than fabrication in CSW's mind.  

&gt;There would not be any liability unless he sold it.

In the world of tax liabilities, that's a tax liability.

&gt;We know he was planting the seeds of the fraud back in that time period, as evidenced by the fake blog post.

So you are saying that it's plausible that he premeditated this several years before with his best friend's 94 year old dad who had lost his son but then never used this himself, just hoped it would come out.  Seriously? This is just one example, there are many things like this he'd have to have done to create the backstory, just consider what he would have to do for the O'Hagan interview - astonishing planning and execution.  

&gt;So what do you think about the link that shows the 1.1m bitcoin are not actually Craig's or Dave's?

To be honest, I'm not sure what to make of this (I've seen it before).  Craig gave wallet addresses that were fake at the same time as giving a fake signing.  The two points are probably linked. Yes, clearly first level thinking leads you to conclude HE'S A SCAMMER!! Second level thinking is he could be a scammer or he could have a reason to leave some doubt/ wriggle room if he ends up in court related to Silk Road.  Both are possibilities.

I ask you this - what level of confidence do you have that CSW was not part of Satoshi?  As a %

I also ask you why, if he was not mining heavily in the early days, did his house (in a residential suburb) have industrial level electricity being pumped into it?

How about the 'coincidence' that early versions of the bitcoin client had poker op codes in it? (Given CSW's history of working with poker sites and on the money transfer problems they were having)

There are so many other things.  All circumstantial.  Like the choice of the The Times headline for the first block - an american would have chosen an american paper.  The Times is exactly the sort of choice CSW would have made.  I know what you're thinking - this isn't proof.  i know it isn't, but these points all add up.  

I am not 100% CSW was part of Satoshi but I am close to it.  To be honest, I'd prefer to find out he was a conman.  Why?  Because that would be a fascinating story and there would be a Satoshi out there still to be found.

One last question.  If conclusive evidence did emerge to validate CSW how would you feel?

I'm enjoying this discussion, I wanted to thrash this out for some time. I really want to learn how people like you can be so convinced that it's not him.  You seem too smart to fall at the first hurdle that he appears to be a scammer / not likeable guy therefore he must be one.

Let those brilliant financial regulators make decisions for you and scrutinize the decisions you make for yourself. You can remain subjected their rules and stay under their thumb.

In ten year though, your 200k will have the buying power of 100k. Bitcoin will almost certainly have far greater buying power than it does today.

When you understand what value (not monetary value) bitcoin really brings to the table, it's a damn safe bet! I sure wouldn't bet on that 1/2% interest rate your money is earning to overcome the inflation that will absolutely render it much less valuable.

Security? Bitcoin is far more secure than banks, but only if you take responsibility for it yourself. Regardless of how much Bitcoin I have, it'll never be worth any arbitrarily large group of hackers effort to try and attack me because I have my private keys secured. They simply can't get it. It isn't available to anyone but me, and if I pass away my family will be able to take possession of it because I have it secured properly. It's not that hard to do. It just takes mindful responsibility. Something you're too afraid of or just lack the confidence to take responsibility for. And if I were more concerned about security, or if I were a large organization with large bitcoin holdings, I'd hire a security service like Xapo to secure it for me. Insured.

"Google Translate: 

All 33 employees of the digital trading platform BTC Direct will receive a part of their salary in bitcoin from next month. Unique in the Netherlands, claims the company that buys and sells bitcoins on behalf of its customers.

You just have to take a look at the course of the bitcoin to see how erratic the price trend is. On the 6th of May, 1 bitcoin scored just under 10,000 dollars, now the digital currency is under 8000 dollars.

With a bit of bad luck, the crypto investor lost part of his deposit next day. BTC Direct employees know the whip and are not awake. Not even if some of their own hard-earned money will evaporate.

The employees received an e-mail a few months ago asking whether they wanted to receive part of their salary in bitcoins and if so, for what amount. The result: everyone wanted to participate and on average for an amount of 100 euros per month. The minimum amount is 20 euros and the highest 500 euros.

There was no question of peer pressure, spokesman Jerrymie Marcus of the trading platform emphasizes. ""To be honest, only enthusiasts who also act from idealism work here.""

It is not surprising that the plan does not come from the management, but from employees. One of those people is 33-year-old Roy Spies. He has studied leisure management and has been working at BTC Direct for a year at the customer contact department.

,, I buy a few hundred euros of cryptocurrency every month. I find it convenient that this will automatically be done later. And it saves me transaction costs of 2 percent, ""says the employee from Tiel. He has opted for a monthly amount of 300 euros. According to the current price, that would be 0.043 bitcoin. ,, I admit: that may sound very little, but all in all it is a nice amount. ''

Despite his enthusiasm, he does see a few downsides. One is that BTC Direct purchases at a fixed time in the month. That may be just at a time when the price is unfavorable. ""But on the other hand, it can also be just at a favorable moment,"" he adds.

Another disadvantage, he thinks, is that BTC Direct only pays out in bitcoin. ,, In addition to bitcoin, I also have other digital coins such as ether and litecoin. I would also have liked to choose another digital currency. ''

Spies thinks that his boss does this very well. He believes that the bitcoin will be around 100,000 euros by 2020 and will become an accepted payment method worldwide. ,, Then it is nice that I already get paid a part in bitcoin. ''

In the Netherlands, BTC Direct seems to be the first company that gives employees bitcoins. Dutch law does have one restriction: an employer must pay at least the minimum wage in euros. Anything that exceeds that amount may be paid in bitcoin. In Germany and Japan there are also companies that pay their employees bitcoin. Meanwhile, more than half a million Dutch people have bitcoin or other cryptocurrency.",1527090420

"Okay, it's time for me to throw in the towel for today so let me share some insights.

**\-\- Image Manipulation \-\-**

First of all, I went the path of analyzing the image itself for anomalies. And lo and behold, **there are letters that are clearly marked with an orange hue**. Take a look at weaknesses, where **two of the three, but not the third ""s"" are marked.** And just look at that outstanding 257! :

[https://imgur.com/a/lzG8SfZ](https://imgur.com/a/lzG8SfZ)

I gave up this path quite quickly though, since these anomalies are not in plain sight. They could however reveal something about how the image has been edited. I saw this by importing the PNG to Inkscape 0.91 and using the Saturation Map filter.

**\-\- 00212121 \-\-**

I mention this because I think that it has not been mentioned yet: **The fact that 0, 1 and 2 are so close to each other in the puzzle can't be a coincidence, in fact it is one of the most visible clues of them all.**

*So what can that mean?*

Either it is just there to draw attention to the 0.00212121 transfer that occurred in relation to the funding of the price address. In this case it is 00212121 that is the clue. Or, 00212121 is there to draw attention to the area around 0, 1, 2 in the puzzle. Somehow I think that the latter makes more sense since there have been so many clues around that area \(attack, early, code, ""Try \+1"", infinity, and maybe 00212121 itself\).

If 00212121 is the actual clue, I think it is related to the generation of BIP39 seeds. A BIP39 seed is constructed by a series of eight three\-tuples of words. One digit could represent one three\-tuple. For example it could be the number of words of each tuple that has a certain property.

**\-\- Limited area \-\-**

Speaking of areas in the puzzle, it is noteworthy that **all ""clue words"" has landed within a quite small total area**. First of all, they are obviously all in the white part of the puzzle. But even within the white part we are mostly confined to an area around 8:30 \- 10 o'clock and 3\-9 o'clock. **I think even the clue ""almost open"" might refer to the word ""open"" being ""almost"" in the area of interest** which would mean that the famous ""X"" might mark the area boundary, perhaps together with the infinity sign in the northwest.

**\-\- ""Missing P:s theory"" \-\-**

"Which is why my first example was more realistic. Venezuela is a fantastic example of what I was referring to regarding minor localized crashes, but a shit example of what would happen if we were to experience another global crash. VZ has shit governance and shit politics to the extent that there is no longer trust in the sovereign currency. In Venezuela's case, something like cryptocurrency is a poor replacement, but is preferable to trusting the government. However, this implicitly relies on trust that BTC will be accepted on global markets.

VZ uses crypto \(and gold and silver\) because right now, people like you and I live in a world where a limited number of parties are willing to trade goods for data \(or metal\). But do the people in VZ actually retain their value with crypto? Short answer is no. Believe whatever you want, but they don't get a better deal. \*They are willing to take a bad deal because a bad deal is better than no deal.\* 

BTC is inherently a low liquidity financial instrument. Even right now, using BTC for a transaction is closer to bartering than spending ""currency"" or ""money"". If '08 repeats and your value is stored in BTC, you're screwed. Why? Because the world came very close to a liquidity freeze. Low liquidity even for fiat currencies is a consistent theme across market and economic crises. Illiquid assets drop to the base value of the asset because value is moved out of uncertain positions and into required resources. In BTC's case, the base value is literally zero. In a few other cryptocurrencies, it's not zero, but it isn't high either.

If you look at the overall history of gold and not just the last recession, you'd see that gold's value \*relative to assets\* has remained remarkably even. The argument for gold holding as an investment strategy is less about ""let's make money"" and more about ""let's not lose money"". Gold's value spikes as a defensive strategy.",1527088248
"The first point isn't an attempt at discredit but rather a legitimate point about the English language.  I've overused the terms ""actually"", ""really"", and ""as it were"" habitually in the past and have found replacing or avoiding them has helped in my writing.   


You speak English far better than I speak your native language so I apologize if it came across as condescending!   


I see your point about the semantic and it seems Merriam\-Webster agrees: [https://www.merriam\-webster.com/dictionary/censoring](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/censoring)  


The ""BTC Trolls"" do not have the *authority* to remove the content *themselves*, but *they do* have access to the means by which to coordinate and abuse an automated system that removes content.  


That said, given the circumstances unless it can be clearly demonstrated that Youtube removed the content and upheld the removal/ban on *subjective* *grounds* rather than the content violating clear guidelines, then a definitive argument of censorship cannot be made. The burden of proof lies on the claim maker and the available information isn't sufficient to make a definitive claim. 

Nonetheless it entails the question: to what extent can the internal decision making of these companies be reasonably explored and how much *actual* censorship goes on given the centralized nature of the platform. For example there's an ongoing grassroots examination to find out if Twitter is shadowbanning and limiting posts by users who use the BCH Tippr bot.   


The term ""soft censorship"" is interesting, but my personal opinion is the semantics downplays the negative implications of the conscious act of attempting to silence content using available means. Perhaps a term like ""Mob Silencing"" could be more accurate, albeit less immediately recognizable without context. That gets in to the ""semantically accurate vs. socially recognizable"" debate that exists in contextualized language.   


Thanks for your insightful post! I hadn't considered the semantic distinction in the term ""censorship"" to that extent and have previously assumed it to include disingenuous use by a third\-party of a platform's tools. You seem like a really knowledgeable person! Thanks again for your feedback :D ",1527088213

All of us who want to hold, spend, and use crypto for other things besides trading are in the tiny majority right now. The traders control the USD price.

2. He faked [PGP keys](https://medium.com/@tbrice/wrights-appeal-to-authority-paper-disproved-its-own-thesis-8f2d45e5df24)

5. He faked [a public key signing](http://nymag.com/selectall/2016/05/craig-wright-s-proof-he-invented-bitcoin-is-basically-a-canadian-girlfriend.html)
6. He has a [well-documented history of fabricating things bitcoin and non-bitcoin related](https://www.scribd.com/document/372445546/Bitcoin-Lawsuit) (see numbers 88 through 102)
7. His own mother [admits he has a longstanding habit of fabricating things](http://archive.is/kjuLi#selection-1655.0-1655.94)

And specifically concerning his claim to be Satoshi:

1. He has provided no independently verifiable evidence
2. He is not [technically competent](http://archive.is/6C3C9) in the subject matter
3. His [writing style](http://seclists.org/basics/2008/Mar/42) is nothing like [Satoshi's](http://satoshinakamoto.me/)
4. He [called bitcoin ""Bit Coin"" in 2011](https://theconversation.com/lulzsec-anonymous-freedom-fighters-or-the-new-face-of-evil-2605#comment_6162) when Satoshi never used a space
5. He [actively bought and traded coins](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/4hx3q9/according_to_the_mtgox_leaks_from_early_2014_our/) from Mt. Gox in 2013 and 2014
6. He was [paid millions](http://archive.is/kjuLi#selection-729.989-732.0) for 'coming out' as Satoshi as part of the deal to sell his patents to nTrust - for those who claim he was 'outed' or had no motive",1527088199

In Spider-Man 's words, ""With great power comes great responsibility "". I'm concerned that this community wants to take all the power from the financial system, but without any of the responsibility.

Tax avoidance. Terrorist financing. Proceeds of crime including human trafficking of women and children into slavery. What are you doing to make sure that these things don't happen? Banks and other financial institutions have to actively monitor and report suspicious activity to help prevent these crimes. Yes some bad ones flaunt and break the law, but at least the majority are trying to do the right thing. Meanwhile crypto seems to be heading in precisely the opposite direction by building the tools that make crime prevention impossible. 

What are you doing about it? Are you saying that your financial privacy from the state is more important than preventing children from being stolen from their parents and sold into slavery? IGNORANCE IS NOT AN EXCUSE. Think about it.

There are many people joining crypto space and many of them think that the Bitcoin train took off long ago and that the value is too high. They are then gambling with cheaper coins that might some day be worth something. It's perfectly natural.

Bitcoin is building a solid foundation where it can be developed further without compromising the most important properties. Therefore it's not even ready for mass adoption yet. Next few years will be very interesting. It's also nice to follow what happens in BCH development. 
At the moment BCH doesn't have much pressure because there aren't many transactions that could bloat the block chain. Even if there was, it seems like pro-BCH people don't really mind about node or mining centralization.

I was talking about his claim of being Satoshi. He willingly 'gave it up'. There is no evidence either way for where the 'leak' came from. The fact that it includes the fake ""Tulip Trust"" document makes me suspicious, though. 

&gt; However I would suggest the number isn't in hundreds but maybe around 100. 

Evidence?

&gt; You'd have to provide me with a reference for this sweeping statement.

See his bet with Peter Rizun. 

&gt; Did you even read my response? A three person team. Sometimes he posted as Satoshi, sometimes someone else did. Not that hard to understand I would have thought.

Right, but 1) there's no evidence for a team, and 2) there's no evidence that they 'switched roles', and 3) this is special pleading.

&gt; Actually many autocorrects do capitalise things. 

Sure, but it wouldn't capitalize **that**.

&gt; We have seen that CSW isn't too bothered about typos.

And the real Satoshi made nary a mistake. Doesn't that imply Craig never was 'that role'? (Assuming there was a team, which there's no evidence for.)

&gt; Why?

Craig supposedly had access to 1 million+ bitcoins. For someone like that to be *actively trading* fewer than 50 is unlikely, but not impossible. 

&gt; Part of that, in my opinion is probably because he didn't want to take full credit, given it was a team.

HAHAHAHA! Seriously?! Are we talking about the same Craig here? The blatant plagiarizer? Come on...

&gt; On that point, have you read Sconty's account? I presume if you've read it you think it all fan fiction, besides there's no proof therefore it can't possibly be true.

Correct. Have you read The Lord of the Rings and think it's a true story?

&gt; you'd understand his assessment of character is well beyond your average journalist

Your evidence that Craig is Satoshi is that a journalist got that impression?

&gt; Point 62. Reference to various documents and transcripts with the ATO and accountant to evidence 1.1m bitcoins. I don't know if you know how these things work but accountants and tax authorities don't just take people's word on things, they AUDIT.

No, there's no evidence that he actually possessed the 1.1m bitcoins. The issue was that he claimed R&amp;D tax credits that he wasn't entitled to. To support that, he claimed ownership of the bitcoin. There was no evidence, though.

&gt; Plus, under your theory, back in 2014 CSW was lying to tax authorities and accountants that he had a potentially huge tax liability

There would not be any liability unless he sold it. 

&gt; Point 104 CSW emails DK's dad in 2014. Under your theory, after his best friend dies he emails his 94 year old father to make this fictitious claim about inventing bitcoin and give him a red herring about searching for a wallat.dat file which never existed.

We know he was planting the seeds of the fraud back in that time period, as evidenced by the fake blog post.

I could be completly wrong though, who knows with crypto. I am down 80% of my money overall and I believe as more millennials start to make more and more money this is only going to go up. A lot of my buddies give me shit for being down thousands of dollars, but long-term I think this will be a life changing investment. Best of luck to all, thanks for reading. ",1527087222

"The higher the dominance, the faster we can run. 

Process we're going through right now, is freeing ourselves from Altcoin/ICO trash. That's why we dip, because people forgot that Bitcoin is great. 


35% dominance suggest that people buy ICO trash right now. We regain dominance, by losing value. 


We're slowly starting a period where people just wake up from their ICO dream world and return to the original useful player, to this day, the only used for anything really, Bitcoin.


____ 


Ask yourself, is it true, that Cryptomarket can grow without Bitcoin growing? 


Because the indicators are clear. Altscoins bleed faster and gain faster. Result is Bitcoin decides if people get rich or end up on the streets. 



And I suspect, that with 35% dominance the Bitcoin interest is simply not high enough. Bitcoin needs to lighter and more strongly present in the market, to once again run like a bull.

That single fact alone trumps any downsides to the banking system, which are largely subjective.

You won't ever get away from that.

So by all means, put on your tin foil hat, run to the hills and be your own bank with your little piece of paper and your hardware wallet (and your ever depreciating BTC).

"&gt;There's no evidence of him being Satoshi, and lots of evidence of him being a serial liar and fraud. 

I think we could go around in circles on this one.  There is evidence of him being Satoshi, however it's circumstantial.  Regardless, I maintain neither of these things conclusively mean he couldn't have been Satoshi. 

&gt;He outed himself

And your evidence for this is where?  I presume you're assuming he placed the leaks with Gizmodo et al?  Where is your proof of this?  Let's hope you're not hypocritical when it comes to proof.

&gt;So do hundreds of others. Maybe I'm Satoshi.

Maybe you are the disgruntled third man in the team?  However I would suggest the number isn't in hundreds but maybe around 100.  That reduces the number of people on this planet that could execute this 'fraud' by about 99.99999%.  

&gt;He doesn't grasp memoryless mining at a fundamental level.

You'd have to provide me with a reference for this sweeping statement.

&gt;So are you trying to have it both ways here? He doesn't write anything like Satoshi, but occasionally he does?

Did you even read my response?  A three person team.  Sometimes he posted as Satoshi, sometimes someone else did.  Not that hard to understand I would have thought.

&gt;Autocorrect wouldn't capitalize it,

Actually many autocorrects do capitalise things.  We have seen that CSW isn't too bothered about typos.

&gt;It doesn't rule him out absolutely, but it makes it less likely.

Why?

&gt;Even his business partners call out that bullshit line:... He freaking loves it. Why was I so certain he’d do that BBC interview the next day? It’s adoration. He wants this more than we want this, but he wants to come out of this looking like he got dragged into it

This was someone's opinion.  Was this person a psychologist?  Did he really know what motivates Craig?  Clearly Craig has a big ego, so maybe there was a part of him that wanted recognition.  But if you read the O'Hagan piece really he comes across at someone who's been rejected by the crypto community and is torn between craving their respect and hating them all.  If you watch how he behaves in all of the interviews his manner, words, and body language all leak how much he doesn't want to do it.  Part of that, in my opinion is probably because he didn't want to take full credit, given it was a team.  On that point, have you read Sconty's account?  I presume if you've read it you think it all fan fiction, besides there's no proof therefore it can't possibly be true.

&gt;That's terrible evidence. Frauds are most effective in person. O'Hagan has no technical expertise, either.

I'm not sure if you're familiar with O'Hagan's work but if you are then you'd understand his assessment of character is well beyond your average journalist.  The fact that he wasn't really interested in the technology adds weight to his character evaluation as he wasn't being bamboozled with new technology, he was looking at the man.  

So, you don't believe the early mined coins referenced in the law suit have anything to do with CSW or DK?  You linked the court papers there, and there is plenty of evidence in that to suggest otherwise.  A couple of examples - 

Point 62.  Reference to various documents and transcripts with the ATO and accountant to evidence 1.1m bitcoins.  I don't know if you know how these things work but accountants and tax authorities don't just take people's word on things, they AUDIT.  Plus, under your theory, back in 2014 CSW was lying to tax authorities and accountants that he had a potentially huge tax liability all to cover a planned 2 year later play to present himself as Satoshi? A really long play.  It just does not seem plausible.

Point 104 CSW emails DK's dad in 2014.  Under your theory, after his best friend dies he emails his 94 year old father to make this fictitious claim about inventing bitcoin and give him a red herring about searching for a wallat.dat file which never existed.  All so there was some evidence (which didn't come out until it was being used against him) that he was Satoshi?  Again, how you can think this is plausible is beyond me.

"""A central bank lends money to banks and these can buy US-bonds for the market price. There is a reason why a central bank is ""private"" and isn't allowed to directly lend money to a government or can be directly controlled by a government.""

You don't see any fundamental issues with Fiat monetary policy as opposed to having a gold based monetary system, or a system of money that is tied to assets of intrinsic value? Fiat, apart from being implemented sporadically historically, is a relatively new phenomena, for the majority of human civilisation we've associated our money with assets such as gold, importantly being due to the scarcity of such assets. Now we've handed over control of our monetary management and supply to a cabal of elitists and bureaucrats, who are more than capable of making human error which can have highly negative consequences for our society. 

""the debt to gdp ratio doesn't grow exponentially"" 

Yes well it would have been interesting in '08 hadn't the State bailed out the corporate criminals, and actually let events play out on a natural or even moral basis. Let alone policies such as quantitative easing, artificially injecting the economy with helicopter money. Temporary bandaid solutions for a much larger underlying wound. 

""yes, i agree. Wars are expensive.""

And immoral. Perhaps without fake fiat dollars the West would be more hesitant to constantly poke the hornets nest in the Middle East, stirring up tensions before deciding it's a great idea to let millions of third worlders from often extremely divergent cultures come and settle in western nations, often on the public purse? Again, not the fault of the average man, it's the fault of govts, aided and abetted by an endless supply of sweet Fiat to keep the machine running. 

""so the debt gave the US the dominating role in the world? sounds like a good investment.""

I wouldn't say the debt made US the most powerful State, Europe had already crippled itself as with China and Japan during WW2 through massacring the shit outta each other, America was much less harmed, aside from their immediate costs associated with their late entry to the war, they didn't have too much debt and went on to boom in the late 40s and 50s largely through ingenuity production and a strong work ethic. They've since gone heavily into debt with the increase in the size of their state and state programs, welfare, stupid proxy wars and economic mismanagement (all empires rise and fall after all). So I don't expect the elite or Statists in America to willingly or altruistically reduce the size of the state apparatus (which costs trillions to run, with all the McGubbment workers and programs) because that would reduce their own power, and result in many angry and desperate citizens (the Free Shit Army is accustomed to receiving milk from the government teat now, and if it ever runs dry, it won't be pretty). 

""bitcoin will sooner or later find its end as well... like everything else.""

I guess we shall see what happens. It may not end up being Bitcoin, something may replace it in future, but I view a decentralised peer to peer currency as being both an enormous technological advancement as well as a good hedge, amongst other assets, to safeguard (and as it's shown in many cases, to even exponentially increase) one's personal wealth.",1527086078

1. He faked [blog posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/80ryvc/craig_wright_2008_august_26_blog_post_i_have_a/duxwsyk/)
2. He faked [PGP keys](https://medium.com/@tbrice/wrights-appeal-to-authority-paper-disproved-its-own-thesis-8f2d45e5df24)
3. He faked [contracts and emails](http://blog.wizsec.jp/2018/02/kleiman-v-craig-wright-bitcoins.html)
4. He faked [threats](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/80o2xf/its_time_for_another_reminder_craig_wright_is_not/duxbjuw/) 
5. He faked [a public key signing](http://nymag.com/selectall/2016/05/craig-wright-s-proof-he-invented-bitcoin-is-basically-a-canadian-girlfriend.html)
6. He has a [well-documented history of fabricating things bitcoin and non-bitcoin related](https://www.scribd.com/document/372445546/Bitcoin-Lawsuit) (see numbers 88 through 102)
7. His own mother [admits he has a longstanding habit of fabricating things](http://archive.is/kjuLi#selection-1655.0-1655.94)

And specifically concerning his claim to be Satoshi:

1. He has provided no independently verifiable evidence
2. He is not [technically competent](http://archive.is/6C3C9) in the subject matter
3. His [writing style](http://seclists.org/basics/2008/Mar/42) is nothing like [Satoshi's](http://satoshinakamoto.me/)
4. He [called bitcoin ""Bit Coin"" in 2011](https://theconversation.com/lulzsec-anonymous-freedom-fighters-or-the-new-face-of-evil-2605#comment_6162) when Satoshi never used a space
5. He [actively bought and traded coins](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/4hx3q9/according_to_the_mtgox_leaks_from_early_2014_our/) from Mt. Gox in 2013 and 2014
6. He was [paid millions](http://archive.is/kjuLi#selection-729.989-732.0) for 'coming out' as Satoshi as part of the deal to sell his patents to nTrust - for those who claim he was 'outed' or had no motive",1527086067

Transferring 76.000 bitcoin as 'spend', while the market drops. I know they want a USD license and its for the greater goods, but being such big bag holders comes with responsibilities. Exchanges are the new banks, taking too much money out of crypto returning only small bits and pieces - meanwhile hiding behind an 'unregulated' economy so in case they get hacked, the users are screwed.

"You're right, I feel Bitcoin and blockchain tech as a whole are completely separate things. Although I am fairly well networked into the European blockchain developers landscape and can confirm nearly every single major company in Europe is working - or already has - a blockchain task force. It is true alot of companies are not sure yet how to utilize blockchain effectively, on the other hand there is a significant number of parties that knows perfectly well what to do with said tech. 

An example:

NATO is likely to use a blockchain for data security and data locality. Using a blockchain all NATO members can exchange information with eachother without using central databases, but using a blockchain instead. This means every single NATO country will retain full control over their data and can still use the blockchain record as a single point of truth that is shared by all participants. Obviously the elimination of the trust factor in regard to data security using blockchain tech is a no-brainer, hence they are adopting blockchain technology. 

As for cryptocurrency, yeah, I figure in countries with fairly stable national currencies and a relatively low amount of corruption cryptocurrency adoption for mainstream economic use will be alot slower than in third world countries with despotic regimes suffering from hyperinflation. I'm pretty sure you can get quite alot of things done for 1 BTC in Venezuela, for example.",1527084178

"&gt; and the creation or printing of fiat dollars aids this process, as money is no longer inherently tied to anything of intrinsic value 

the US government cant print money.

&gt;but rather issued at a whim by totally-honest and benevolent central bankers in collusion with governments.

A central bank lends money to banks and these can buy US-bonds for the market price. There is a reason why a central bank is ""private"" and isn't allowed to directly lend money to a government.


&gt;As for paying the debt back, plus the ever-growing interest it's accruing , ill hold my breath, the national debt doubled under Obama's 8 years in office alone (so in 8 years as much debt was accrued as the 230-odd years of the USA existing beforehand). 

how does the total nominal value matter? what matters is the debt to gdp ratio which was around 110% in the past as well and recovered to &gt;40%

&gt;The debt's growing exponentially. 

the debt to gdp ratio doesn't grow exponentially

&gt;A Fiat system since '71 and policies of leftism , as well as neocons funding the military industrial complex and starting wars all over the damn place, have all contributed to this massive debt problem.

yes, i agree. Wars are expensive.

&gt;The US State can't just cut their expenses, unless they are to drastically reduce their own power

so the debt gave the US the dominating role in the world? sounds like a good investment.

&gt;No, again I'll hold my breath, they will continue this Fiat game until it meets it's inevitable fate and ends badly

However, is there a list anywhere as to which lightweight wallets work with this BITCOIN Core node wallet? Is there a write up anywhere on how to do this as I am still relatively a newb at running a node and the inner workings. 

Also, Is it useful or suggested to use a VPN or TOR along side running the NODE? My thought here is to mask the IP address so as to node be able to see I'm running node. If it is something worth while for privacy, is there also any write up or link to how to do this as well?

Especially because taxation over the revenue on these products is usually handled by the companies that provide the point of sale systems, a shift to cryptocurrency would mean a shift toward responsiblities on who handles (and is responsible for) keeping track of the records for the tax man. Tokenization is another form of cryptocurrency that's finding more and more adoption, e.g. JP Morgan's tokenized securities could mean a major shift for traditional Wall Street trading.

The only means that can drive adoption for cryptocurrency as a payment mechanism is being better than the alternative. I doubt Bitcoin, Ethereum or IOTA will outperform the euro or Canadian dollar anytime soon. However, Bitcoin adoption in countries such as Rwanda, Zimbabwe and Venezuela is unparalleled. I'm not surprised it doesn't roll as well in Canada (or in the Netherlands, where I'm typing from). ;)",1527083774

There is clear and direct evidence of him lying on multiple occasions, in ways that have benefited him personally and have directly harmed others.  I can not speak to his motivations for doing that, or for what he does now, or for the investments he makes.  All I know for sure is the pattern of evidence that follows him and that continues to appear whenever he goes.  It is entirely possible he has turned a new leaf and is genuine in his desire to help the community and is piling his money into that goal.  I doubt it, but it's possible.  I think it's more likely that he's out for personal gain.  Maybe he thinks this venture, even if there's no con, is just a good investment for him.  Or maybe there's ulterior motives that we just don't have enough information to see.  I don't know.  All I know is what he's done in the past, and my own beliefs about how reliable such information is at predicting the future.",1527083500

Oh the irony.    
Speaking of playing dirty.    

https://m.imgur.com/a/ydbmVVY   

Roger Ver is actively misleading people into believing things that are are not true. 

Consensus is essentially the foundation of what cryptocurrency is all about. 

As it stands, consensus in the cryptocurrency community states: 

 1. Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash are two separate cryptocurrencies. 

 2. BTC and BCH are the ticker symbols representing Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash respectively. 

Because of this consensus, it is reasonable to conclude anyone who wishes to honestly pair the ticker symbol along side the name of a cryptocurrency would do so in the way the overwhelming majority have already agreed upon. Which is:   

Bitcoin (BTC)   
Bitcoin Cash (BCH)   

The methods displayed by Roger Ver are clearly fraudulent and deceitful. 

""Bitcoin Core (BTC)""   
""Bitcoin (BCH)"" 



Because of the facts I have stated above, I believe it is reasonable to conclude the names Roger Ver regularly publishes to identify the two different cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash, are not only confusing but dishonest, deceitful, and fraudulent. 


Roger Ver is a fraud playing dirty with his ownership over Bitcoin dot com, his moderator status on this sub, and his influence on other platforms. Yet has the audacity to say others are playing dirty?

"Yes I did pick up on your sarcasm. 

You believe dollars are more valuable than bitcoins.

I believe bitcoins are more valuable than dollars.

&gt;The subjective theory of value is a theory of value which advances the idea that the value of a good is not determined by any inherent property of the good, nor by the amount of labor necessary to produce the good, but instead value is determined by the importance an acting individual places on a good for the achievement of his desired ends.

I don't trust dollars or their issuance. Your chargeback comments again are misinformed because you don't understand bitcoin or the technology. 

In Bitcoin the feature you are looking for is called ""escrow"". It can be implemented with multiple-sig (2 of 3) in Bitcoin.
In your PayPal example, there is a trusted 3rd party (PayPal.com). Both the sender and receiver trust them to handle disputes, making a human decision to let the receiver keep the money or giving it back to the sender.

Bitcoin doesn't have a trusted 3rd party built into the system, but one can be used at any time. This is called escrow.

In this system, the sender uses multi-sig to send a payment to a destination that needs 2 of 3 signatures to send it to the final destination. the 3 signatures are the sender, the receiver, and the 3rd party (escrow company). The receiver will put the first signature on the transaction that sends the money to himself, but he needs a 2nd signature to receive it. When the sender receives the merchandise in the mail, he can add his signature, which gets the money to the receiver (merchandise seller).

If the sender (merchandise buyer) does not receive the merchandise, he will open a dispute with the escrow company asking for his money back. If the dispute is resolved in his favor, then he and the escrow company sign a transaction the sends the money back to him.

On the other hand, if the seller (receiver) does not receive his bitcoin in a reasonable time, he can also open a dispute with the same 3rd party.

&gt;(which is probably why over 1,000,000 bitcoins have been stolen in hacks despite being protected by ""immutable"" cryptography).

See this just proves you don't know what you're talking about. 

When have ""over 1,000,000 bitcoins have been stolen in hacks despite being protected by ""immutable"" cryptography""?

If you mean bitcoins stolen from Mt. Gox hacks, you're wrong. Bitcoin's cryptography wasn't broken, the centralized exchange was hacked into. Everyone who has ever lost bitcoins in hacks did not control their private keys, which means they didn't own their bitcoins. I'm not sure you understand this concept. 

&gt;Thinking cryptography makes you safe is like putting an unbreakable lock on a wooden door. no one cares if they can't break the lock when they can just kick the door down.

So then you must have multiple instances of bitcoin's cryptography getting hacked then right?

What are those examples?

"Considering all the information publicly available, my opinion is that the most important pieces of the puzzle are missing. The public does not have direct physical access to the data leaked to Gizmodo and Wired. We all speculate, but the real truth might be completely different \(perhaps the story is much more complicated and multiple conflicting interests were involved\). Maybe someone knows, but keeps quiet. \([https://medium.com/cryptomuse/how\-the\-nsa\-caught\-satoshi\-nakamoto\-868affcef595](https://medium.com/cryptomuse/how-the-nsa-caught-satoshi-nakamoto-868affcef595)\).

Craig is an intelligent person who knows that there are a lot of very smart people out there. Every move made by him has consequences and he is very well aware of that. Skilled con artists do not leave transparent trails behind. Either Craig is an amateur con artist \(highly unlikely due to the whole chain of events\), or he is tweaking the truth on purpose due to the reasons I explained \(survival\). The problem is that most of us cannot even comprehend the scale of the impact of the leak. The only viable escape route in that scenario is to obfuscate all data. Phony denial doesn't help, it makes things worse.

There is no firm evidence whether Craig is or isn't Satoshi at this stage. Other possible key players are long time dead. A lot of data has been destroyed.

&gt; We have some leaders that get a lof of money from nChain and they are trying not to say anything that will stop the money from flowing to them

"It's actually not that far off. The volatility of the top 100 cryptos are around 5-20%. It's not that uncommon for lower cap stocks to fluctuate by 5% in a day.

The problem is with only a handful of exceptions, there are no fundamentals driving prices so price is determined most entirely by sentiment. And that's because, as the title says, no one is using blockchains. And the few people that are certainly aren't ""normies"".


We badly need securities and asset backed tokens. Dividends for example, from the profit of a ""normie"" company would make people much less likely to dump said token when bitcoin goes down a bit.

"&gt; none of these mean he can't have been Satoshi.

There's no evidence of him **being** Satoshi, and lots of evidence of him being a serial liar and fraud. You can draw whatever conclusions you'd like from that, but to deny that this makes him *beyond-a-reasonable-doubt unlikely* to be Satoshi is insane.

&gt; He may have good reasons for this. Look at what happened to DPR. It was clear when he was outed he was not happy about it or do you think that was acting?

He outed himself.

&gt; He appears to have a deep understanding of the system but not a complete one

So do hundreds of others. Maybe I'm Satoshi.

&gt; There are many so-called crypto experts that have been exposed to have some fundamental misunderstandings of how bitcoin works, I have not seen this ever from CSW.

He doesn't grasp memoryless mining at a fundamental level. 

&gt; Satoshi was a team

Do you have any evidence for this?

&gt; some of his writings would have been others from that team. Besides, this thread is an example how he writes exactly how satoshi did.

So are you trying to have it both ways here? He doesn't write anything like Satoshi, but occasionally he does? 

&gt; Haven't seen that before. Maybe autocorrect? Far from conclusive.

Autocorrect wouldn't capitalize it, and he spelled it that way several times. It's clear that he doesn't have a good grasp of what bitcoin is at that point.

&gt; Not sure why this can't make him Satoshi?

It doesn't rule him out absolutely, but it makes it less likely. Furthermore, Craig claims to have lost huge sums of money from MtGox (millions), which is another lie. At most, he lost about 50BTC, which, at the time, was much less than $100k.   

&gt; Wright never wanted that

Sure, Craig is so camera-shy. Even his business partners call out that bullshit line:

&gt; We spoke about Wright’s possible lies. I said that all through these proof sessions, he’d acted this like this was the last thing he ever wanted.


&gt; ‘That’s not true,’ MacGregor said. **‘He freaking loves it. Why was I so certain he’d do that BBC interview the next day? It’s adoration. He wants this more than we want this, but he wants to come out of this looking like he got dragged into it.’** He told me if everything had gone to plan, the groundwork was laid for selling the patents. It was a really big deal. He said Ramona had said that if Wright doesn’t come out you still have this really smart guy who has made all these patents, who knows all about bitcoin. ‘Yeah,’ MacGregor said. ‘You and five hundred other guys who have called today.’

.

&gt; If there was a rat he would have sniffed it out.

That's terrible evidence. Frauds are most effective in person. O'Hagan has no technical expertise, either. 

&gt; So I ask you this. Do you believe the claims in the law suit that Wright / DK had approx 1.1m BTC from mining in the first couple of years of bitcoin's existance?

Of course not. There's no evidence that Kleiman had *anything* to do with bitcoin, and there's [solid evidence](https://blog.wizsec.jp/2018/02/kleiman-v-craig-wright-bitcoins.html) that the bitcoin referenced in the lawsuit belonged to others. 

However, it's basically a win-win situation for Kleiman's family. There are two cases: Craig is Satoshi or he is not. In the incredibly unlikely scenario where he actually is Satoshi, they have a strong case and will likely collect something substantial, based on the complaint.

Even though he's not actually Satoshi, it's *still* a good idea. To get rid of the lawsuit, Craig would probably have to show evidence that he's *not* Satoshi, and Kleiman's family knows he'd rather not do that (nor would nChain, since they'd immediately lose more credibility and potentially a lot of money). So, it's in *everyone's* interest to settle the case. And if they do settle, Craig supporters will think it's more evidence that he's Satoshi!  A win all around.",1527081782

"The urge to avoid a confrontation is one of the primary attack vectors by which humans are exploited.

Every time it feels like the idiots are winning (they broadly are), Bitcoin &amp; the ideas behind it put the smile back on my face.",1527081559
"I will clarify this so further and hope it helps.

xCurrent joins different Financial Institutions, entities banks etc. all to the RippleNet. Ultimately it is all about how many partners or institutions you have on your network, the core network and then you can sell any other product you like on top. 

So when you hear that bank in Japan is building its own blockchain etc. do not confuse this, they very well might, but they are worth nothing without existing connections via a reliable network to other institutions worldwide, hence the genius idea of introducing them all to xCurrent and show blockchain first by itself.

Now for liquidity they have xRapid, it works with xCurrent and sources XRP and can save FIs further 70\-90&amp;#37;\(Ripple is conservative with figures, but look at the latest test results, bank a account to bank b account in 2 mins, not crypto to crypto, bank a to bank b, cross\-fiat\). This saving is money they can pocket use elsewhere or give out to customers, upto their models. 

xVia is an API or a service anyone can call with minimum infrastructure to use RippleNet and XRP to do a payment, hence very easy to adopt. 

xPring is not a software nor is it part of Ripple's suite, that is a misunderstanding, it is their venture capital type initiative to fund other projects that can demonstrate good use of XRP. 

ILP is like a standard, being currently accepted and worked upon more with industry leaders, for connecting everything together and can assist any crypto, but works best when XRP is used as the bridge asset. It can be used for Gold, identity, micropayments, forex anything really and will eventually be part of our browsers even once an approved standard by the industry. 

Codius is like running ERC20 token, however some great differences, e.g. David was quoted saying you can store btc private keys on it, but can't with erc20 etc. 

Cobalt you will hear dropped as well, that is literally just the name of the new algorithm or software upgrade that takes XRP even further. 

XRP a month ago needed only 17 more validators to be more decentralised than ether and btc both, not sure about now.

  
Hope that clears it up around the current different Ripple buzz words and tech.",1527081554

I'm not even a huge bitcoin supporter, it's about 10% of my portfolio and the only reason I have them is I bought a lot of them to gamble with for $800 years back and managed to not piss it all away.  Doesn't mean I'm not smart enough to discern that bcash is **not** bitcoin.  I could create Pepsi Kola in a territory with no IP protection and peddle it to be the original vision of Pepsi since it's truer to the original formula, doesn't make me not a total nut job and con-artist.

"Not a limitation so much as a balancing act. Bitcoin focuses more on decentralization and security over speed and cost, however lightning network should compensate for these shortcomings!",1527081392
"This isn't how bitcoin works. The blockchain doesn't care what people think, and anyone who understands bitcoin won't think anything different. ",1527081345
"Why get a load when things like crowd funding exist? Think about it in a decentralized consensus economy, where if you need money for somethinf you don't have, you have to get it based on trust in your product or what ever. The community that's interested in your product can fund you, and there's then not much need for loans anymore.

Though, you're right on the tone of Exchanges. I think a major fix for this is going to be something like Cardano's future Universal Wallet that uses side chain. So imagine ease of use, the ability to store Bitcoin on a wallet with your other assets instead of on an exchange. One of the blockers behind Wallets noe is the learning curve and ease of use/access. Once people get past that, it should considerably be more attractive to have self custody of your assets.",1527081325

"Bitcoin is permissionless. If you have a quota on blocksize, it's clearly not Bitcoin because its access is limited to a small elite. Bitcoin Core, despite the name, has little to do with Bitcoin any more. Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin, or rather the best approximation of Bitcoin we ever had. Bitcoin Core is a coin operated by Blockstream. Centralized coins are a legitimate option though, altcoins are allowed to do whatever they want, but a coin centrally operated by Blockstream is clearly not what Satoshi Nakamoto had in mind in the paper.",1527081217

"You keep reinstating strong personal opinions as facts. The only clear thing here is that you hate his guts, but without really offering any deep insights, or trying to apply any kind of balanced criticism...

&gt; confrontation a genuine business man (with a product)

Really? The Bitcoin Gold guy? ...


&gt; Why on earth are some of our influential people like Roger Ver okay with lowering their moral standards as long as enough money is involved.? They talk about bettering the world but don't see corruption at play in their own lives? 

Because they actually meet and talk in person and that allows them to perceive directly who are they talking to, who they are, what energy they have, what's their deal, etc. Instead of depending on the interpretations of interested third parties and the filters of media. Correct me if I'm wrong but I suspect you haven't actually never met CSW in person, or talked with him about your concerns.

&gt; WHAT A FUCKING DISGRACE. And if the Bitcoin Cash community allows this kind of bullshit we will never build a strong community. 

This game is soon becoming much bigger than you seem to realize, and the ""Bitcoin Cash community"" is no longer constrained to this subreddit. There are a lot of people investing a lot of resources in this nascient industry, in order to make Satoshi's Bitcoin a reality, while ensuring their place as the big players. And that is happening in the real world, with people that have a lot of skin in the game, making really big bets.

&gt; I know the difference between reality and a day dream

Are you absolutely sure about that?

"It's hysterical watching you all whine and complain while your shit alt coin remains shit. Nothing a BTrasher says is believable because you're all hypocrites justifying the shameful attempts to promote BTrash as Bitcoin. If BCash was Bitcoin, it would be called Bitcoin, but it's not because it's a shit hard fork just like the other 41 hard forks. BCash is useful as an alt coin. It provides no store of value. You all ""declaring"" your shit coin is valuable is hysterical \- you don't determine what succeeds, the market does, and BCash hangs on by a thread through shameless shilling through your intentionally misleading marketing. BCash will remain a shit alt coin because no one wants to use a desparate alt coin trying to pretend it's something else and going to the lengths it has to mislead people into buying BTrash by disguising it as Bitcoin. ",1527080666
"You said yourself that you put more into crypto savings than into fiat savings. 

Crypto should be viewed as a zero sum, due to the pickle you now find yourself in. In the long run, several years, the risk of it actually being zero sum is far less, but short term this is how it should be viewed, as if it’s not worth anything. Frankly, tomorrow it could be worth much much less or much much more. A backup on the other hand should be stable.

The entire point of the phrase, “never invest more than you can afford to lose” means you need to get rid of the “my crypto is my backup” mentality. Crypto is not your backup. Your backup is your backup. 

If you would have only invested what you could afford to lose, you’d have the backup to be able afford rent right now. 

I’m not trying to be a dick, but your mentality needs altering in my opinion. ",1527080660
"This is like saying everyone should move from the dollar to bitcoin to help the crypto market.

There is a reason traders trade against bitcoin pairs. It is tried, true and a trusted store of value.

Secondly, i dont think the silk road creator had any clue who satoshi was (IF satoshi was a real person - really big IF) but instead “satoshi” saw the huge global need for an annoynomous peer to peer decentralized payment system. 

It just so happened that the silk road was created after bitcoin had already been around for a couple years. They definitely helped each other grow, getting btc more daily traffic and more people mining, and the silk road for being able to have drugs delivered to your doorstep anonymously.

To answer your original question, no. They most likely had no clue who the other was, but i don’t think either of them would have become as successful as they are (were in silk roads case) without the help from the other

"Anonymity is very important, not only to protect ourselves, but to protect everyone else. I'm glad you get it. 

Far too many people have taken on the ""I've got nothing to hide"" narrative and THAT just empowers THEM.

The only reason the catholic church was able to lock down Europe in 7 centuries of 'dark ages' is because they knew everything about what everyone was doing and thinking through their confessional, yet the people knew nothing at all about what THEY were doing and thinking.

We are entering the dark ages again, in a way, where everyone will keep their head down so as not to be singled out. It is through our loss of privacy and anonymity while THEY are all about secretive anonymous actions.

While the watchers know everything about us, We know nothing about the watchers. In this way they control the narrative and are able to pit neighbors against neighbors, divide and conquer.

Bitcoin is here to fuck up their plan, yet we allow OUR P2P trading platform yo be compromised.

Just a few days ago before I deleted my account, I posted to the forum about this state of affairs and was swamped with brainless repeaters saying 'what have you got to hide'' and other nonsense sticking up for their oppressors. And then the thread was frozen !!!!

I think Ripple giving XRP away to charity is great for crypto as a whole. They're giving away crypto to people who might not be in the industry. They're getting it in front of eyes, they're forcing people to use it to claim the $4m and they're doing it with well-liked/trusted celebrities showing it in a positive light, rather than appearing on 60 minutes in an article about child porn and dark web or weird nerds who got rich overnight.

Upgrades to software can be fine, in fact sometimes upgrades and refactors are done which can remove some technical debt.

However real technical debt is smelly stuff that has to stay around *forever* such as what they did with Segwit.

Soft forks are mandatory - if you don't upgrade to a soft-fork you cannot fully mine, for example a miner trying to mine Bitcoin with pre-segwit software would be unable to properly validate blocks to build on as all segwit transactions would appear to him as ""anyone can spend"" when the technical debt says they're not really ""anyone can spend"" but just appear that way in segwit so it could be done as a soft fork.

Segwit with a proper hard fork and a proper code for a segwit TX and thus no technical debt would of been the proper way to do it. Those miners that wanted to upgrade could of upgraded, and those that didn't could of not upgraded.",1527079663

"OK, let's do this.

&gt;Craig Wright is a serial fabricator and liar. Here's just some of the evidence:


Some or all of these may be true.  There may be unknown motives for these actions, but none of these mean he can't have been Satoshi.

&gt;And specifically concerning his claim to be Satoshi:
He has provided no independently verifiable evidence

He may have good reasons for this.  Look at what happened to DPR.  It was clear when he was outed he was not happy about it or do you think that was acting?

&gt;He is not technically competent in the subject matter

He appears to have a deep understanding of the system but not a complete one - he was part of a three person team, so there is bound to be some gaps in his knowledge.  The whole SM debate was academic handbags.  There are many so-called crypto experts that have been exposed to have some fundamental misunderstandings of how bitcoin works, I have not seen this ever from CSW.

&gt;His writing style is nothing like Satoshi's

Satoshi was a team, some of his writings would have been others from that team.  Besides, this thread is an example how he writes exactly how satoshi did.

&gt;He called bitcoin ""Bit Coin"" in 2011 when Satoshi never used a space

Haven't seen that before.  Maybe autocorrect?  Far from conclusive.

&gt;He actively bought and traded coins from Mt. Gox in 2013 and 2014

Not sure why this can't make him Satoshi? Maybe he was doing that for someone else? Maybe he was trying out trading?

&gt;He was paid millions for 'coming out' as Satoshi as part of the deal to sell his patents to nTrust - for those who claim he was 'outed' or had no motive

Finally you post a quality source from a quality journalist.  If you've read the article (which I did a while ago) the deal is to create IP to then sell with the movie rights to satoshi's identity wrapped up in that.  Wright never wanted that but had to swallow it to get the deal - he needed the money.  He thought that the movie stuff would be many years away.

Andrew O'Hagan is no fool.  He spent months with him and those around him.  If there was a rat he would have sniffed it out.

So I ask you this.  Do you believe the claims in the law suit that Wright / DK had approx 1.1m BTC from mining in the first couple of years of bitcoin's existance?

Exactly, totally agree with you. Unfortunately, this subreddit is very hostile to any kind of criticism, even though this criticism could help to drag more attention to certain weak points of a LN protocol, and eventually improve a whole project.

Because the Bitcoin idea itself was hijacked by powerful interests, who feel threatened by the original Bitcoin idea. So they took control of it -- that is, they took control of Blockstream/Core development -- and made sure the coin would remain useless as a currency, so to mitigate the threat.

Because as a consequence of the above, all of crypto is being held hostage by a useless 'king' shitcoin at the top. Comprendes?

Of course it helps if your especially good at picking this weeks big pump and even easier if your bags are big enough to actually help create it.

It doesn't necessarily mean the HODL strategy is foolish, it just means your gains will be as equally minimal as your risk. It goes up, it retraces itself. The losers are those that jump on an uptrend too late, which is most people actually,

Obviously, the risk for traders is that they might just have passed Step 5 and wake up to find a bull market in full charge. It will happen eventually, but they are hedging that any loss that this might incur will still be less than the sum of the small gains that they made over the quiet period.

This really isn't any different to the stock market. There are long term investors (low risk/slow gains) and traders (high risk/fast gains)

What you cant predict is when or how this influences the next ATH because there are so many factors outside and beyond the control of just the traders.

"&gt; Lightning webpage says they do not broadcast into the blockchain. So they keep tabs on lightning ledger.

Yes, I already said ln tx are not broadcast. However, not broadcasting a tx does not constitute a sidechain. Tx's on sidechains are not valid transactions on bitcoin. Every single update of a LN channel is a valid bitcoin tx. You can broadcast this tx to the network if you please. As I said, 

&gt; And no, LN is not a sidechain. Its a system of bitcoin tx's that makes it possible to update the one bitcoin tx between two parties without the risk of the other party broadcasting and old bitcoin tx.

&gt; Can you guess who suggested updating bitcoin tx many times without broadcadting the tx to the network?

I have never claimed that you were wrong about how LN works (except its not a sidechain). I have claimed that if your argument is that LN tx are not bitcoin because they are not on-chain, then 0-conf tx are not bitcoin either. This is what I've been saying again and again and again. Call LN whatever you want, that doesn't make 0-conf any more bitcoin if you apply the same argument to 0-conf tx.

&gt; Cross-chain atomic swaps can occur off-chain instantly with heterogeneous blockchain consensus rules. 

Yes, LN supports atomic swaps also between other blockchains that support it. That does not make LN a sidechain. Really, as any of your bcash friends about this.

You really need to *read* my posts instead of just hitting reply.

And again: I **really** don't care how little or much you consider LN bitcoin. What I care about is **only** that your argument is that its not on-chain, and therefore not bitcoin which makes 0-conf not bitcoin too. You are welcome to come with a new definition that suits your needs. This is actually the only thing I'm interested in. We are currently working with *your* argument. And I completely accept, that if we use *your* definition of bitcoin to be ""must be on chain"" then sure, LN would not be bitcoin under that definition (although I don't agree with that definition, but thats another case).

Just one thing about LN. Who do you think came up with these off-chain payment channels? Like, updating a tx again and again without broadcasting? Who do you think?",1527076764

That behavior is utterly uncalled for or designed to try to push CSW out because his rivals fear thatn his participation and his technology will leap frog theirs.  nChain's business model is based on the success of Bitcoin Cash which means that we all benefit from their efforts.

Always. And I wish some of our influential people would finally think long and hard about that. Now there are some genuine business like nTrust (now nCrypto) that got bought by nChain.

"I also believe that bitcoin cash is currently more centralized than bitcoin as well. I'll have to do some more research into it to make points that are 100%, but here are some basics:

1) One of the biggest things I hear stated is that computing power is constantly increasing, so large 1tb, or 1gb blocks will not lead to centralization because computing power will increase over time to prevent this. The worrying factor is that chips are already very very small. 

2) Bitcoin cash is way smaller than bitcoin, and not used nearly as much. Look at the block size for recent blocks, and the amount of transactions in them and compare to bitcoin blocks. 

Now with the amount of usage, look at the alliance of Jihan, Roger, and CSW. Those 3, via Bitmain, nChain, and Bitcoin.com hold way too much influence over the chain, especially considering it's level of daily use. ",1527075532

Faced with a choice between upgrading RAM (often this means a new computer for the node, not just plugging in an extra memory module) and retiring a Bitcoin node, some Bitcoin node operators will choose to shut down  
Previous discussions (and a research paper) have concluded that increasing the block size will cause a disproportionate loss of nodes, a more centralised node network  

The other issue, which is not covered by any graph, is that the block interval is a time buffer which allows nodes to reorganise after miners propagate orphan blocks",1527071622

DogeCoin? Financed the Jamaican Bobsled team to go to Sochi for starters. Has an entire philanthropic foundation setup.. I wouldn’t call Ripple the only crypto doing positive things for the wider world. I’m sure there are many others too.,1527071318
Yeah thought the same thing. Read chapter 5 of Mastering Bitcoin,1527071301
"Thank you both u/[Chex0](https://www.reddit.com/user/Chex0) and u/[DistinctSituation](https://www.reddit.com/user/DistinctSituation) for your comprehensive replies. I think both of your arguments are getting at important aspects of Bitcoin's security, but I am of the opinion that your emphasis on non\-mining full nodes rather than mining nodes is misplaced. Let me try to explain why and perhaps you can tell me what you think.

First, on an attack by state\-level actors—which I think has always been the biggest risk to Bitcoin. There are two way for this to proceed: \(1\) a 51&amp;#37; attack on the network, which is why it is important that Bitcoin maintains huge hashing power. In this sense, corporate mining operations and huge energy consumption add to network security. \(2\) state actors attempting to shut down the network by force \(your suggestion\). But if this is the play then states need not shut down every non\-mining full node to ""make it unusable for most regular users"". Killing the chain requires only that states shut down the miners—if blocks stop then  the chain is dead. So I'd suggest that protection against state sponsored attacks requires both the maximisation of hashing power \(to prevent attack 1\) and a wide geographical distribution of full nodes and mining nodes \(to prevent attack 2\), rather than a simple proliferation of non\-mining full nodes as suggested. 

Second, decentralisation as protection of the immutability of the blockchain. u/[DistinctSituation](https://www.reddit.com/user/DistinctSituation), I think that the way you've framed the issue of at 51&amp;#37; attack requires us to make a distinction between: \(1\) an attack that attempts to change the protocol, eg.  changing the mining rewards to ""create Bitcoins out of thin air"", and \(2\) dishonestly using the consensus rules, eg. censoring transactions and double spending by re\-writing the blockchain.

The reason why it's necessary to distinguish them is because I suspect these different attacks would provoke very different responses from the network. Attack 1 seeks to change the consensus rules by voting with majority hashing power. However, unless this attack is initiated almost unanimously by miners then it will result only in a fork of the blockchain, with a majority chain mining according to the new inflationary rules and a minority according to the old rules. Both chains will, at least in the short term, be viable. However, because it is in no one's interest \(except  the attackers\) to use the new consensus rules, all economic activity will be continued on the minority chain. Hence, the miraculous bitcoins appearing on the majority chain will be economically useless. 

The other attack is more complex because there is no clear splitting of the chain according to consensus rules, but only on the basis of disagreements amongst miners about the history of transactions. On this point, I want to challenge your distinction between the immutability of the history and of the future, because I see the blockchain as a machine for establishing the sequence of \(past\) events. These events are by definition always in our past and the question is always only ""what happened and when?"". As you've suggested, the blockchain makes it exponentially more difficult to change this historical record the deeper we look back in time. In this respect, the point at which a miner gained majority hashing power is irrelevant to the question of changing the ledger. If the miner wants to alter the history of past transactions then they must re\-do all of the proof of work from that block onwards, even if they had majority hashing power during this time.

So, what exactly can dishonest miners achieve with a 51&amp;#37; attack? They can \(1\) commit double spending attacks, \(2\) censor transactions and thereby destroy Bitcoin's function as peer to peer cash. The former will result in a dramatic loss of confidence in the protocol and a corresponding loss in bitcoin's market value. And the rest of the network would likely respond by waiting for many confirmations before accepting payments. But given that these dishonest miners will destroy their own wealth in the attempt to steal some real\-world product without ""paying for it"", this doesn't seem like a rational action by someone motivated by economic incentives. The analogy I see is that the biggest corporations *could* easily destroy global capitalism, but they won't, because that would be economically irrational. 

On \(2\), my point from the above post was that if we're worried about dishonest miners censoring txs and destroying bitcoin's usability as peer\-to\-peer cash, then why aren't we worried about the censoring of transactions that happens in a so\-called ""fee market""?

Anyway, sorry, this post is way too long. The way I see it, Bitcoin's security model is based on the assumption that no colluding dishonest miners achieve 51&amp;#37; hashing power. *If* this happens then everything goes out the window, full nodes or not. ",1527071285

"Which is more than fine. As explained, probability of creating above chain by accident is practically 0.  Because two miner will have to mine approximately at the same time 1 and 1', the other two miners will have to mine 2 and 2'  at the same time, and so on until 6 and 6'. Most of bitcoin sidechains are just one orphan block in length.
The only reason how second sidechain of length 6+ can be created is by secretly being mined. When the hidden sidechain, of length 6+, is made public to the rest of the network, the rest of the network would just ignore it. Node with double spend chain will remain on that chain unless manually switched to main chain.",1527067891
Bitcoin Core is a disaster. ,1527067887
"Smart guy clearly, but the alternative currencies he's comparing were nothing close to the actual currencies the world is used to. To explain; he's referencing currencies that were linked to a value of power or labour offered. What about those that had no power or ability to offer labour. These other currencies failed, because they had not properly included the inclusion of all around the world and thus, could not be easily adopted by the world.

Cryptocurrencies are only similar to the examples given in the fact that you must have an internet connection and some electronic device with which to use them. This would normally be a killer and lump crypto in the same boat as Labor Notes except for the fact we are now entering a new epoch of human industry where connectivity and access to communications are now starting to be seen as a basic human right \(more so if we consider electronic currencies access to basic needs such as food and water where banks and fiat currencies are clearly failing\). We can produce a basic electronic device for very little that could allow crypto payments but that is not even necessary as most people around the world now have mobile or satellite phones.",1527067872
"Hardly any shitcoins have a real reason to exist. That's what makes them shitcoins. For instance, BTrash has no reason to exist because Litecoin already existed, but Litecoin has no reason to exist because Bitcoin already existed.

"I got inin June right before the bitcoin cash fork, and it was a WILD fuckin’ ride. ",1527067750
"Stability will only emerge when the amount of money in bitcoin is much, much larger than the amount entering/leaving across small time frames.

Right now, Bitcoin's a tiny pool of money with a huge profile- a volatility perfect storm. Exchange for goods will both seed and characterise a more stable state, but there's more to it than just that.",1527067746
"Technically anything is possible but to change bitcoin to not use the blockchain would need incredibly hard proven testing to show it works and trustworthy. To do that youd setup another chain, perhaps with atomic swaps, to solve this and show the new technology works.
If it was shown to work far better than bitcoin people would want to sell their btc and buy the new coin at which point what is the advantage for bitcoin to change too?  All eggs in one basket springs to mind.

So in summary, no it is incredibly unlikely we would see bitcoin replace its working and proven engine.

We may however see another segwit style split but most likely see a new emerging coin that solves any bitcoin shortfalls IMHO(eg scalability, fungibility, privacy, qc enhancements, smaller min specs for nodes, improved usability, etc)

Right now ive yet to see a vastly better coin but there are contenders trying new approaches like iota, byteball, zcash, ethereum, etc so who knows, bitcoin is still a fascinating experiment.",1527067724
"This is just sad. The fee is higher because of the 1mb limit. Only 33% of the network even has segwit transactions. Btc is broken and is only supported because it is the main trading pair and is the most known. If you cannot scale than your chain will die, which it will 100%.

"The counterarguments are not solid. First, it gives an example of how bitcoin can be used as store of value, but it misses the point that \(bitcoin is down 5&amp;#37; today, more than 50&amp;#37; down from half a year ago\), yes it is still up on a yearly basis, but it does not make it a SAFE store of value. This is because the demand and even the supply \(and thus the price\) is driven by the speculation. This is not a legitimate use\-case.

The second point, is not countered, but reinforced. The bolivar got hyperinflation because of a corrupt government, thus it just proves that the underlying country steers the fundamental value of the currency.",1527066826

It’s bizarre they are allowed to operate in the modern world with such insecure systems.  Apple, Google or even the banks themselves are soon to remove the need for visa/mc because those payment companies are too slow to adopt crypto and have a solution the tech companies will want to use.

1. You can throw out at least half of the words in the picture
2. Think in pairs
3. Code easily, attack early
4. Lost transaction costs almost users
5. 00212121
6. Try \+1
7. Almost open
8. Bonus clue: To triumph, one must look within. To infinity, and beyond. When you are close to home, X marks the spot. \(from here\)
9. \-1

**WHAT DOES THIS ALL MEAN???????**

**MY ANSWER:**

**First off**, I think, that the picture does not have the seed words to the bitcoin address. Even if it does, it might not be systemically linked together, rather than scattered across.Second, I think that the whole picture is just a bacground for decoding the private key through **Elliptic Curve Cryptography and the finite \(prime\) field.** [LINK](https://medium.com/chain-intelligence/tldr-guide-bitcoin-private-key-public-key-and-public-address-623ad99768c3)

I base my opinion because:

**Second** **clue**: Think in pairs.

&gt;Bitcoins themselves are not stored either centrally or locally and so no one entity is their custodian. They exist as records on a distributed ledger called the block chain, copies of which are shared by a volunteer network of connected computers. *To ""own"" a bitcoin simply means having the ability to transfer control of it to someone else by creating a record of the transfer in the block chain. What grants this ability? Access to an* [*ECDSA*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_Curve_DSA) ***private and public key pair***\*\*.\*\* What does that mean and how does that secure bitcoin? [LINK](https://www.coindesk.com/math-behind-bitcoin/)

I think the first clue is given as gentle nudge into this direction.

**Third** **clue:** code easily, attack early.Even though all of these words can my acceptable BIP39 words, there is one problem: Attack early is next to each other, and that is ok, but code and easily are seperated quite significantly. How does this help? I think it falls right into the ECDSA theory quite well. These are probably the points on the Elliptic curves, on the  finite \(prime field\). **Same thing goes for the fourth, seventh and sixth clue**

**Fifth** **clue**: 00212121

Honestly, I cant remember, but I saw, that an 8 digit number of somesort is also significant to this ECDSA thing, but I honestly cannot find the page I found this.

**Sixth** **and** **ninth** **clue**: Try \+1, \-1. Since \-1 is nowhere to be found on the picture, it reminded me that, that there exists a group law on the set of all points on a given elliptic curve \(**where \-1 IS significant**\). See [LINK1](https://medium.com/chain-intelligence/tldr-guide-bitcoin-private-key-public-key-and-public-address-623ad99768c3) [LINK2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generating_set_of_a_group)

**Eitht** **bonus clue**: To triumph, one must look within. To **infinity**, and beyond. When you are close to home, X marks the spot. It so happens, that **there is also a point of infinity on the ECDSA curve AND on the picture**. [LINK1](https://medium.com/chain-intelligence/tldr-guide-bitcoin-private-key-public-key-and-public-address-623ad99768c3) [LINK2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_at_infinity) [LINK3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic-curve_cryptography)

**These coincidences leave me to believe, that the picture is a an encrypted map of the private key. If so, I believe, that if the picture would be decrypted with the ECDSA curve** ***OR SOMETHING IN THAT NATURE*** **PERHAPS, you could find the private key, or at least come closer to it.**

**WHAT DOES THIS ALL MEAN???????**

**MY ANSWER:**

**First off**, I think, that the picture does not have the seed words to the bitcoin address. Even if it does, it might not be systemically linked together, rather than scattered across.

Second, I think that the whole picture is just a bacground for decoding the private key through Ell**iptic Curve Cryptography and the finite \(prime\) field.** [LINK](https://medium.com/chain-intelligence/tldr-guide-bitcoin-private-key-public-key-and-public-address-623ad99768c3)

I base my opinion because:

**First clue**: Think in pairs.

&gt; Bitcoins themselves are not stored either centrally or locally and so no one entity is their custodian. They exist as records on a distributed ledger called the block chain, copies of which are shared by a volunteer network of connected computers. *To ""own"" a bitcoin simply means having the ability to transfer control of it to someone else by creating a record of the transfer in the block chain. What grants this ability? Access to an* [*ECDSA*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_Curve_DSA) ***private and public key pair*****.** What does that mean and how does that secure bitcoin? [LINK](https://www.coindesk.com/math-behind-bitcoin/)

I think the first clue is given as gentle nudge into this direction.

**Second clue:** code easily, attack early. 

Even though all of these words can my acceptable BIP39 words, there is one problem: Attack early is next to each other, and that is ok, but code and easily are seperated quite significantly. How does this help? I think it falls right into the ECDSA theory quite well. These are probably the points on the Elliptic curves, on the  finite \(prime field\). **Same thing goes for the third, sixth and fifth clue.**

**Fourth clue**: 00212121

Honestly, I cant remember, but I saw, that an 8 digit number of somesort is also significant to this ECDSA thing, but I honestly cannot find the page I found this

**Fifth and eight clue**: Try \+1, \-1. Since \-1 is nowhere to be found on the picture, it reminded me that, that there exists a group law on the set of all points on a given elliptic curve \(**where \-1 IS significant**\). See [LINK1](https://medium.com/chain-intelligence/tldr-guide-bitcoin-private-key-public-key-and-public-address-623ad99768c3) [LINK2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generating_set_of_a_group)

**Seventh bonus clue**: To triumph, one must look within. To **infinity**, and beyond. When you are close to home, X marks the spot. 

It so happens, that **there is also a point of infinity on the ECDSA curve AND on the picture**. [LINK1](https://medium.com/chain-intelligence/tldr-guide-bitcoin-private-key-public-key-and-public-address-623ad99768c3) [LINK2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_at_infinity) [LINK3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic-curve_cryptography)

**These coincidences leave me to believe, that the picture is a an encrypted map of the private key. If so, I believe, that if the picture would be decrypted with the ECDSA curve** ***OR SOMETHING IN THAT NATURE*** **PERHAPS, you could find the private key, or at least come closer to it.**

"The comparison with Bitcoin is unfair because Bitcoin did not start like what it turned in to. Bitcoin use to have instant transactions because once you broadcasted a tx it was guaranteed to get in to the blockchain, thus allowing zero confirmation.  Satoshi wrote: 

&gt;I believe it'll be possible for a payment processing company to provide as a service the rapid distribution of transactions with good-enough checking in something like 10 seconds or less.

&gt;The network nodes only accept the first version of a transaction they receive to incorporate into the block they're trying to generate.  When you broadcast a transaction, if someone else broadcasts a double-spend at the same time, it's a race to propagate to the most nodes first.  If one has a slight head start, it'll geometrically spread through the network faster and get most of the nodes.

&gt;A rough back-of-the-envelope example:
1         0
4         1
16        4
64        16
80%      20%

&gt;So if a double-spend has to wait even a second, it has a huge disadvantage.

&gt;The payment processor has connections with many nodes.  When it gets a transaction, it blasts it out, and at the same time monitors the network for double-spends.  If it receives a double-spend on any of its many listening nodes, then it alerts that the transaction is bad.  A double-spent transaction wouldn't get very far without one of the listeners hearing it.  The double-spender would have to wait until the listening phase is over, but by then, the payment processor's broadcast has reached most nodes, or is so far ahead in propagating that the double-spender has no hope of grabbing a significant percentage of the remaining nodes.

Core devs broke this functionality by introducing replace by fee and by letting the blocks get full. This made Bitcoin unreliable for 0 conf.

BItcoin Cash restored this functionatliy so if you want to compare Nano the way you did you need to compare it to  Bitcoin Cash.

While nano's tech is awesome I have a problem with it's economics. Where is the incentive for people to run the nano network so that transactions are executed?

With Bitcoin the fees makes sure that after the generation reward runs out, as long as by that time it's doing hundreds of millions of transactions a day, there is an incentive for running the network.

So how does Nano solve this?  ",1527064367

For security.

People have been ablr to choose between looking after their own money (via cash storage) or using the services of a Bank for years, and 99.5% of people choose to keep it in a bank, and they do so for security and protection.

The only people not wanting to keep it in a bank are those in corrupt countries, money launderers, tax avoiders and criminals who need to keep their money hidden.

With Bitcoin this doesn't change - you're kidding yourself if you think people in the developed world will want to keep their savings and get their wages paid into anything other than a regulated / government protected banking system.

"This is a very good analysis! I would differentiate between the decentralisation of the network and the usability for its users though. 

Decentralisation, as you correctly said, depends on the decentralisation of the blockchain and the mining power.  When the blockchain is not decentralised, then the history cannot be said to be immutable. If the  the mining power isn't decentralised, then the future cannot be said to be immutable. With future I mean that one cannot be certain that transactions added from a certain point on \(let's say 7 blocks before the mining power became centralised\) don't create Bitcoins out of thin air. Therefore, the network cannot be trusted from the point on when the mining power becomes centralised. However, the history of the network still can be trusted since it would be very, very, very unfeasible to re\-create 400k\+ blocks, but it would be feasible to re\-create 6 blocks with the majority of the mining power.

My point here is: Both the history and the future of Bitcoin need protection. The history can be protected by having many independent full\-nodes that keep their own copy of the blockchain. The history can be protected by keeping the mining power distributed and mining pools independent of each other. 

The rationale behind BTC's \~4MB blocksize cap is to protect the history of the blockchain. When blocks and the blockchain as a whole become too large for a normal Joe to keep a copy of it, then that normal Joe will stop doing so, and the history becomes more centralised, which threatens its integrity. Hence, by making it less feasible to keep a copy of the blockchain, you threaten the history of Bitcoin and make yourself even more vulnerable to governmental attacks since there are not enough normal Joes left to keep an independent copy of the blockchain that could function as a backup if governments decide to crack down on Bitcoin. It is easy to crack down on a couple of data centers that hold the blockchain, but much harder to crack down on 10k\+ independent citizens all over the world. 

Now, opposite to this rationale is the argument of usability. A user needs to be able to send transactions without delay or excessive fees with which I agree. The question only is, how do you achieve usability and not threaten the history and future of Bitcoin? I don't think that LN is the holy grail, but it might help to take some pressure off the network. I believe there is no single solution to this problem. Increasing the blocksize is definitely part of the solution, but eventually I think there must be a combination of different solutions, some of which you can see now already like incentivising batching.

"Since you're the one who insists that BTC is ""superior to gold"", I don't see how this question is relevant. However, in an attempt to have a good faith conversation, the short answer is no.

The more fleshed out answer is only kind of.

Assuming a relatively minor and localized market crash, a pre-crash gold position is a hedge against the local medium of transfer (i.e. currency) and can *help you reduce your losses in the event of a crash.* More significantly, there is opportunity cost to holding that gold. Gold will not prevent all losses unless you happen to be actively trading and have miraculous timing. 

An extreme market crash will see the value of Gold fall to nearly zero as people will be literally fighting over life sustaining resources. At that point, we won't need to worry about any form of currency because we'll have reverted to a barter economy. You can't eat metal or data. ",1527061019

&gt;every single one shows me intelligent debates/discussions, helpful Q&amp;As, and most importantly, a generally really positive and optimistic overall tone and point of view. I don't get that from this sub at all.

I don't see much of a difference between all the crypto-related subs on this point. (and others)

To illustrate my point, here's a Top post on r/litecoin about BCH:

https://np.reddit.com/r/litecoin/comments/8l8sc6/i_watched_a_bch_lecture_to_see_what_theyre/

Filled with lies and false misleading statements like this:

&gt;They're even planning on eventually evolving BCH into something like ETH (can't make this up, you'd have to watch the video....so much for satoshi's vision)

Satoshi's Vision was for smart contracts on-chain!

&gt;The system is entirely decentralized, without any server or trusted parties. The network infrastructure can support a full range of escrow transactions and contracts, but for now the focus is on the basics of money and transactions.

&gt;Satoshi - http://nakamotostudies.org/2008/08/22/satoshi-and-wei-dai-correspondence/

Satoshi also said this:

&gt;Bitcoin is fundamentally designed to be able to do non-reversible transactions, and there certainly are applications that need that.

&gt;If someone wants the possibility of chargeback, they can use an escrow transaction, which isn't implemented yet but will be one of the next things.  For instance, a transaction can be written to designate a third party to decide whether it is returned if the payer does not release it, with auto-release after a number of days.  **I'll implement a more basic form of escrow first, but the network infrastructure includes a predicate language that can express any number of options.**

&gt;https://plan99.net/~mike/satoshi-emails/thread2.html

And this discussion with Mike Hearn:

&gt;&gt;I haven't fully
understood why sequence numbers are a property of the tx inputs rather
than the tx itself.

&gt;**It's for contracts.**  An unrecorded open transaction can keep being replaced until nLockTime.  It may contain payments by multiple parties.  Each input owner signs their input.  For a new version to be written, each must sign a higher sequence number (see IsNewerThan).  By signing, an input owner says ""I agree to put my money in, if everyone puts their money in and the outputs are this.""  There are other options in SignatureHash[...]

If newcomers to crypto are seeing this know that if you like freedom you won't have a good time going with Bitcoin Core, because it's all about control and domination. 

While the project was suppose to be about freedom. Financial freedom. You can't have financial freedom when your voice get's silenced and your opinions ignored. They talk about permissionless but they are hypocrites. They talk about decentralisation but all their systems are centralised.

The faster the market dumps Bitcoin Core, the faster Tether blows, the better.

It's time for this absolute shitshow to end. You assholes tried taking control and you are loosing grip on the project hard and fast. And together with the enemy of my enemy, the peeps at /r/buttcoin I am going to enjoy  seeing Bitcoin-BTC and all the shitcoins and shit ICO's drop to zero.

Now the market will rob you your price and all your cult victims will loose all their wealth. But you guys probably already have converted most of it to fiat anyways. Assholes.

The only thing I have literally done with this account in the past 4 months is use it for crypto purchases. 

Related news in the same spectrum, is someone I know was actually going to start getting into crypto, and their visa card (from a different bank) has also been blocked to apparent suspicious activity and now they haven't been able to use their card for anything online for the past two weeks.

"Rat poison is a currency that allows for quantitative easing as a means of bailing out the banks for crashing the economy. But by rats, I mean the 99% of us who struggle financially. That rat poison is pure debt (all fiat money is actually debt). So money in its current form only produces wealth inequality. Bitcoin can’t completely change wealth distribution but it is the most powerful tool we’ve ever seen to do so. This is because of the network effect that raises its value as more users join in. And because it’s divisible, it’s much easier for poor people to buy. If you want to buy into Berkshire Hathaway you’ll need nearly $300,000 for one share!

my favorite web wallet, myetherwallet.com let's you send. Almost all of BCH's ecosystem seems to assume you don't want to use BCH on the web, but on your phone or in cold storage. The closest BCH analogue to mytherwallet appears to be https://cashaddress.org/ but it seem to have any way to send. I failed to find anyway to just send BCH on my browser which seems pretty basic, and sorry, but I don't really want my crypto accounts on my phone (At least not for now).

Once I entered my key, I'm presented with way too much info detailing my public private key. I see 4 things that could potentially be my public address.

"Investments in public stocks go up or down based entirely on speculation. The price is driven by the amount of people willing to buy or sell the stock. There is no direct relationship to a company’s profits and the value of their stock unless they offer a dividend.

Despite the fact that Wall Street operates a Greater Fool Scheme, they host a platform for the majority of “good” investments.

Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies actually serve a function and have inherent utility. Many tokens have been created to pay people for sharing their resources (content and attention for ads, shared computing, internet access to name a few). 

As for Bitcoin, it allows for cheaper and quicker international money transfers while being a more secure protocol than a centralized bank can offer. Hackers are currently stealing about $500 billion every year because of centralized (single point of failure) systems. 

Bitcoin also gives us a way to store our wealth without enabling the greedy and destructive banking industry that makes money off of our money, does not share those earnings with us, and buries us in debt by charging near-predatory interest on loans.

"**Reference implementation**

In the software development process, a reference implementation (or, less frequently, sample implementation or model implementation) is the standard from which all other implementations and corresponding customizations are derived. An improvement to a reference implementation reflects an unchanging specification. Conversely, a failed attempt at an implementation may prove that the specification is not suitable and needs improvement itself. Testing the implementation-vs.-specification relationship further enhances the production's inter-process efficiencies:



A reference implementation is, in general, an implementation of a specification to be used as a definitive interpretation for that specification (This definition is a bit grandiloquent but works).

"Good morning community! 

Was wondering, what is your best guess as to how likely is the market to repeat relative &amp;#37; movement compared to as what happened between end of 2013 Mt. Gox scandal all the way through 2016 June, where market reached back to previous all time higs and eventually way beyond. What would be facts supporting but also facts dismissing market repeating itself.   

In another way to look at it for example would be something similar to Nasdaq dot\-com bubble and following years, in crypto relative speed and market movements. As Mt. Gox scandal and following bearish market had somewhat different fundamental reasons compared to perhaps something more similar, such as dot\-com bubble.   

1\) To put it into approximate numbers: On first case scenario total market cap would bottom around 150B in about half a year and stay stagnant for about 1 year and after which could start slower bullish growth for about 1 years to eventual ATH.   

2\) As to compared to similarities to Nasdaq dot\-com bear market and following recovery, markets would bottom in the very near future around last time low of about 240B, followed by rather quick recovery in about 5 months back to ATH.  

Of course there is always an option, that markets never really recover and slowly bleed until this whole space is just a wasteland of former hopes, dreams and glory.   

Or there is always option, that black swan type of event will occur and change everything, such as crypto sorting out its legislative difficulties, which would offer some bigger funds/institutions to start opening small positions in bitcoin, which would quite quickly jump start the market, followed by other institutions jumping on board. 

Community, would appreciate your thoughts on this matter?",1527057058

"When there is a stock market crash whole world will be affected. I even doubt if Crypto could survive the crash because most people still don't consider crypto as a safe investment and when these people want money they won't be selling there safe assets , they will be selling crypto. If dollar falls all other currencies will most likely follow it. Many of the rich wallets are just hodlers , they won't sell in a crash because they believe in the tech. People like Average Joe will start selling because they will be needing money but who will buy? I believe no one because there is already enough fear in the market.  There will be news of crypto being a bubble etc etc but once the recovery starts i think we will be in the gilded age of cryptocurrencies where we will see exponential growth. This would be the time for new currencies to emerge and all other shit projects to fade away. 

This could go the other way too , people fear , they invest in crypto but the problem is we are still far away from adoption. We could also see huge potential investors turning the crypto market to a bull run but i don't think it will most likely be the case. In case of depression , people just want to have money in their hands rather than investing in bitcoin. When there is fear , there is greed too , people who believe in the tech will still invest in crypto but the buys won't be enough to match the sells.

"Breaking News: ""Crypto market has more sellers then buyers!""",1527056178
"The full story:
I invested in Bitcoin at the end of 2016, times were good. As the price began to go up my friends would ask a lot of questions about what Bitcoin was and how it worked. I answered honestly, not trying to sway either way. At the end of last year at the peak of its upwards curve one of my close friend decided he had to get in the game, and took at a $7,000 low interest government university loan to buy Bitcoin, thinking the price would soon be over six figures. Well that was a great fucking idea wasn't it.

Dreaming of getting rich quick, and DEFINITELY investing more than he could lose it was obviously a recipe for disaster. I must say it is mildly amusing that the government now has him by the balls because of a completely unregulated cryptocurrency..

Price drops, he loses two thirds of his investment, and now blames me solely for losing that money on Bitcoin.

What did I do?

I was so fed up with his whinging on our group chat of friends, that I created a card game one night called 'Bitcon' to simulate losing your money investing in crypto. I took it to uni saying now he could lose his money with out actually losing his money.

One of our friends (a graphic designer/videographer) loved the idea and offered to help me actually make it into a game. I jumped at the chance to keep the prank going longer. We designed the cards, created graphics and a cool video, and this morning launched the game on Kickstarter. The first person I messaged? The original idiot still crying about losing his cash.

"Hi. 

I’m in online merchant. I have run my online store for 18 years.

I had Bitcoin as a payment option in 2013. Do you know how many orders I got using bitcoin, in 2013, five years after it was created?

Zero in the first year. 

Zero in the second year. 

Zero in the third year. 

And I see 400,000 unique users a month. 

Zero bitcoin orders.

Back then, there were guys like you running around saying bitcoin was a “failure” because nobody used it.

And yet here you are using the same retarded logic. And lecturing others on logic. 

BCH started from scratch nine months ago. Bitcoin wasn’t even being used by regular people five years into the project. Why don’t you sit back and give it a little time? 

BitPay just added it to their 100,000 merchants. BitPay is the LARGEST bitcoin merchant processor in the world and hadn’t supported a single other Crypto than BTC since Day 1. 

Now they support Bitcoin Cash. That should mean something to you. If you’re into logic.",1527054818
"This is **anything** **but** another lightning network... And our team had been studying Proof of Work even before the Bitcoin whitepaper was published, and P2P networks since the 90's, so we're not entirely clueless... We also built Bitcoin's FalconNetwork for that matter.

You want to do on\-chain transactions? Great \- as do we. That's why we built bloXroute, to allow on\-chain scalability.

""But it just works!"" you might be yelling. Well, turns out you can't just arbitrarily increase the blocksize and reduce the time between blocks. why? because if you increase the  blocksize by x10, everytime a node sends a block to another node is going to take x10, which increases the probability for forks by x10. So you can do x10, but things break if you try x100.

Well \- relay networks \(Falcon/Fibre\) solve that, don't they? Well, yes, but if you **have** to use them it breaks the security model, which is why we built bloXroute \-* a Provably Neut*ral blockchain distribution network \(BDN\), which solves this probl**em, is neutral, open\-source, and **free. We give it to all blockchains and crypto to solve the networking bottleneck, and they can decide what and how they want to use it.

Our business model is in the future to add even further capacity, which reduces the fees \(miners require less incentives\), so those who wish to opt in to this fee\-reduction service can do that if they want to, but nobody has to.

I hope I was able to explain the difference between us and ""them"" \- but I'll be more than happy to provide more details.

"Wow, twisting my words to proof what? 0-conf is as good as confirmed. You know ""is as good"" right? I'm literally putting them on equal here. Technically they are on 2 different segment of the blockchain but have equal standing in BCH.

Mempool is not on-chain, but in queue to get mined in the next block for BCH. That's not the contention I had with you, don't trust it around. My contention us that lightning isn't even queuing on BTC network, it's literally separated on a totally different network. Mempool is part of the node memory, lightning is not. Get that right. Yes, mempool is in the node waiting to get mined, hence it's part of the network in queue. Lightning is not part of BTC node and runs separately, in a different program altogether. I've been consistent in pointing this out but clearly you don't read and are trying to twist my words, as you can censor my truths, you need to twist it to fit your lies, it's understandable for someone coming from rbitcoin.

"The push by parts of the community to pretend block-space is infinite and that fees aren't needed.

Core was wrong to try to limit the blocksize, and wrong to want a hamfisted auction of blockspace. Breaking away from that is good, but becoming extremists in the opposite direction hurts Bitcoin Cash's long-term viability.

* The main chain is not a suitable solution for true micropayments. Develop payment channels or something, instead we pretend the main-chain is a good long-term solution for that just because not many people are currently using it. Not even credit cards handle micropayments, and central databases are more efficient than blockchains for that.

* The blockreward is halving every four years. Bitcoin Cash needs to still be a viable currency when there's no meaningful blockreward. Positioning ourselves as the currency of zero or near-zero fees is either a temporary plan, or going to fail.

* The larger the size-magnitude of the blockchain the less queries and other things we can do with it. Large is good - the more transactions there are, the lower the fees/electricity per transaction once the blockreward is gone, but with excessive size comes a cost laden onto the ecosystem. Jameson Lopp became a small-block advocate because of the trouble he had at work keeping a system able to query the existing blockchain fast enough (or something like that), it's hard to believe they couldn't handle 100GB but I don't know what they were doing and I've not been in that position myself, so I take the fact that there was a problem seriously.

It scares me how Bch crowd are so eager to fill the blockchain with shit, instead of just scaling ahead of demand, developing micropayment protocols, encouraging a culture of fees that blow legacy banking out of the water and can still eventually sustain Bch etc.",1527054631

"&gt; Take software from 2014 and let it spin up. It will sync on the Bitcoin network.

I didn't mean in numbers but in hash power. You'll say ""No way"", but what I mean is, miners mine what's profitable. They don't mine BTC because they support it, but because it pays the bills.

"You don’t have to be all that intelligent to foresee the economic collapse on the horizon. Although, I’ll tell you right now it’s not going to be caused by subprime auto loans, or the baby boomers. The next collapse will be due to (subprime) student loan debt, coupled with the continuously lower demand for tedious jobs performed by humans that could otherwise be performed better by computers (such as lawyers, real estate agents, most government employees, and a slew of others).

So before I digress any further — although I your conspiracy concept of satoshi actually being Uncle Sam (or any other government). It’s tough to imagine a democratic government that would ultimately be interested in putting itself out of business, unless that democratic government has one person that has a vested interest in having global power (via amassed crypto wealth). I can think of a few countries that could fit the bill, but hey, anything is possible!",1527051605

"Could there be any technical reason why the P=0.000... numbers from the whitepaper (they come together with the z= numbers) are not in this puzzle? I find it hard to believe that, since we have both numbers containing decimal points (q=035) and number from the second column in the tables (z=24) present. Which means the author has deliberately removed these from the puzzle, maybe as a hint.

These numbers proves/shows the ""security model"" of Bitcoin, which this puzzle ""challenges"" (by removing them).

I don't really know what to make of this, but I'm playing with the idea that we are looking at some kind of block race of two chains, and the ""pairs"" are the blocks from the two chains. The race would then finally be resolved by the 13th block (which would only be one word acting as the passphrase to unlock the wallet, hence the +1). Since the change to the puzzle now probably that extra block has been removed.",1527051500

Dash has anti-features making it *less* desirable than a simple copy coin. For example instamined, centralized (masternodes), fragile features (instasend and darksend) and their own version of ""LN will magically solve everything"" (Evolution).

There are problems with all the coins, but now you're being overly dismissive.

&gt; BTC

Network effect. Still the most accepted coin and is BCH's main competition.

&gt; ETH

Also network effect. If BTC fails it's the coin in the best position to overtake the throne.

&gt; Monero - if you want to wait around for several minuets to buy your coffee totally anonymously for some reason.

0-conf is perfectly acceptable on Monero as well. At least try to come up with actual arguments.

&gt; Sarcasm, no XMR does not want to be everybodies everyday go-to currency for every transaction

Only a few devs wants this, for example fluffypony wants it to be a settlement layer like BTC. I don't agree with this view.

Yet again network effect. It's more accepted than Dash and (for now) has fast and cheap-ish confirmations.

"In the history of the world, NO FIAT currency has survived.

That's right, they all went to zero. 

Gold and Silver, however, have held their value for 5000 years. 

The USD and all fiat currency loses value daily through inflation. So, it's not really a conspiracy theory. It just happens so gradually that normal people don't notice.

A meal that costs your Dad 50c in his childhood now costs you $10. 

but nobody really pays attention because they assume wages have kept up. In fact, they simply haven't. Wages in the US are flat over the last 3 decades. Assuming 3&amp;#37; inflation x 30 years, you're losing 90&amp;#37; of your value. You can easily see that in practice with home prices, car prices, college tuition etc......Even basic things like the BigMac  Index can show you purchasing power has eroded.

"This bill does nothing but offer modest reform for regional and community banks. None of the major global banking institutions are getting any relief. All that is being changed is that smaller banks will have less stringent reporting regulations. There will be no repeal of the volcker rule I think with the exception of banks with less than $10B in assets. 

This bill is merely for political purposes; with 2018 midterm elections coming up Republicans can use this to say they have kept their promises to reform Dodd-Frank without changing very much at all. On the flip side, the Democratic strategy will be to make a lot of noise and say that the Republicans are purely acting in the interests of Wall Street and not the voter.

The truth is that there will be no real consequences if this bill is or is not passed. None of ‘the big players’ will really be getting any added benefits. The purpose of the bill is for the Republicans to ‘rally their base’  to convince them they are getting things done in DC, but do not understand how little this bill changes things.The Democrats will similarly oppose the bill to appeal to voters who were hurt in the financial crisis, but who do not understand how little this bill changes things.

The only problem with your comment is that you're giving .gov the gift of foresight, which they've proven to never have had.

Were I a game theorist, that's exactly how I'd get out of this fiat nightmare.  Sink fiat by allowing multiple currencies to be legal tender.   crypto, gold/silver, hell even the euro.   In a free market honest money would crush paper and then foreign debt could be paid back with a sinking USD while things like social security could be paid with honest money.  We could then escape this with a small bit of integrity leaving the fed to clean up their own mess.

"**Rules for Radicals**

Rules for Radicals: A Pragmatic Primer for Realistic Radicals is a 1971 book by community activist and writer Saul D. Alinsky about how to successfully run a movement for change. It was the last book that Alinsky wrote and was published shortly before his death in 1972. His goal for the Rules for Radicals was to create a guide for future community organizers, to use in uniting low-income communities, or ""Have-Nots"", in order for them to gain social, political, legal, and economic power. Within it, Alinsky compiled the lessons he had learned throughout his experiences of community organizing from 1939–1971 and targeted these lessons at the current, new generation of radicals.

"Each Bitcoin Node connects with some number of other nodes, by default 8.  When a node receives (or successfully mines) a new block, it first validates it and if it is valid then it tells the other nodes it's connected to about it.  Those nodes then go through the same process and after a bunch of iterations of this, the whole network learns about the block.

BCH would have worse propagation times than BTC because a larger block takes more time to validate (slightly) AND more time to upload to / download from other nodes.

Propagation time is important because the longer a block takes to become known by the whole network, the greater the chance of it being orphaned becomes.  Similarly, the longer a miner takes to learn about a new block, the more time they waste on ""useless"" blocks, and therefore the less profitable the miner is.",1527048933

"Financial economist here. Ceteris Paribus, the relationship between treasury bonds and equity markets (stocks, property, cryptos etc) is definitive. In a low interest rate environment, investors flock to assets in search for capital gains. In a high interest rate environment investors pile into debt securities and T-bonds in search for higher yields to maturity. 

IMO this moon lambo nonsense is the direct result of low interest rates, and liquidity premium. These coins that have these grandiose visions of a sci-fi future really are just short-term money making operations. It's literally innovation back to front. Generally with innovative digital technology like youtube and facebook etc there is a strong market demand prior to IPO. With cryptocurrency it's the complete opposite - bar a relatively small amount of cryptos with strong use cases. 

Anyway, once those yields on bonds spike upwards above 3% possibly towards 20%, equity markets like cryptos, stocks, property etc will collapse (50-80%). This is because the market is under the grand illusion that t-bonds are somehow default risk-free. This will cause a tremendous amount of deflation in the economy, as equity capital is the main source of employment funding. With a massive spike in unemployment central banks will probably begin some sort of giant scale Quantitative easing program (much bigger than we have today) in order to suppress yields and stimulate economic growth through employment and inflation. 

QE4 is what will rapidly turn a deflationary economic environment into a hyper-inflationary environment. This will be when the price of cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, bitcoin cash, ethereum etc will absolutely skyrocket to levels we cannot possibly fathom. The other theory that I think has some validity is that deflation, on a scale much worse than the great depression, will cause war and social upheaval that could end up in emancipation of government from central banks, or the two of those things all together. This could lead to the price of bitcoin plummeting to levels towards $200-$500. However, the relative price of goods and services would also plummet far worse and the actual purchasing power of bitcoin could still be maintained through disinflation, especially when people lose ultimate faith in fiat currencies.

"Yeah. I'm basically saying that if their is an anticipated exodus of the dollar/stocks because of a financial crisis, the smart, rich people (including the government) will jump ship before mom and pop do. Banks and governments might get into crypto before selling pressure (and downgrades from ratings agencies) kills equities and other financial instruments. Of course clueless small investors will lose the value of their stock-equities/retirement portfolio because wall street will dump their equities first and already be in crypto when shit starts hitting the fan for ordinary people. Basically the same thing happened in 08 with the ratings agencies pretending like things were good while banks got the hell out before the crash. 

The one thing that never seems to get mentioned about equities is - who is going to buy them when baby boomers sell them to retire? 20 something kids? They don't have that same wealth and they don't trust banks anyway. I find it unlikely that young people will support the stock market. And, if all you have is sellers, well, the crypto community knows what happens when everyone is selling at once. Price plummets. ",1527046892

"One thing I'd like to know from those who think CSW is a fraud - how does he appear to understand how bitcoin works, how it started, what it can do more than pretty much anyone else?  All this time under the microscope and he still hasn't slipped up.  How plausible is that? And if he were an impostor (which is the word they should be using giving he's not attempting to take people's money) how brilliant would he have to be to pull it off?

Think about it this way.  If you wanted to pretend you were satoshi the best strategy would be to remain a mysterious figure whilst trying to get as many people as possible to give you money.  CSW has done pretty much the opposite.  He remains controversial and aggravated, like someone who's built something and had it taken away from him. ",1527046774

"&gt; a) Have a genuine requirement to run a node

I’m not sure i’m on board with your premise here. Almost nobody has a “requirement” to run a full node, since you can always just trust that the rest of the network will validate and enforce the protocol for you. With 100,000 full nodes, the marginal value of a 100,001st might be close to 0, but how few is too few such that all that trust becomes dangerous?

I think an alternative way to frame it might be “who has a right to run a full node”, since the premise of BTC is that participants aren’t *required* to trust anyone. 

But to your point, should that right extend to everyone, all the way down to the absolute least resource endowed person on earth, with access to only the ability to run what’s needed in a computer capable of today’s BTC network in perpetuity? That seems kind of absurd, too.",1527046113

Additionally, I dislike how BCH community tries to put the entire crypto community down. They literally pick fights with numerous different crypto communities. BTC won’t do this; they’re facilitating main trading pairs with other cryptos and expanding the entire crypto network.

Old investors like Warren Buffet and John Shiller keep calling Bitcoin a ""failed experiment"" and ""a waste of money"" but I honestly think we're far from this.

Imagine one day when you have Cryptocurrency wallets on every single cell phone. People are using blockchain apps like Steemit, BAT and Substratum in their everyday lives. The next version of Crypto Kitties is out, and it is a huge hit. This time round, there is no more server clogging \- blockchain has advanced greatly in terms of scalability.

You no longer need to worry about converting your crypto to fiat and vice versa \- OmiseGo takes care of that for you, on the fly. Crypto is fiat. Crypto is now worth everything. New developments and technological breakthroughs are happening almost daily \- courtesy of developers making use of the technology from Golem, Cardano and AI tech like Invacio. Any kind of information you use is stored on the cloud, on Siacoin or Dadi and other similar providers. The biggest companies in the world are now all vested into blockchain, one way or another, working with blockchain giants like Ethereum, VeChain, Neo and Icon, among others. Following the mass adoption of Cryptocurrencies, the entire Crypto market is now valued at 20 Trillion USD.

Now, Smart Contracts make up a significant portion of everything that is going on in the CryptoCurrency Market. With the adoption of new technology comes new security risks. Blockchain crimes done through phishing and hacking are on the rise. But you don't have to worry. People can no longer scam their fellow human beings like could with Fiat. The essential use of Blockchain starting with Bitcoin meant there you're funds would be safe as long as you can keep them safe. Products like Quantstamp remove all kinds ICO scamming by carrying out audits that immediately flag scam projects and remove them from existence. Projects like Pundi X and BABB now take care of your everyday financial needs. There is no longer the need to carry a wallet of any form, just your phone. No credit cards to lose, no physical money to get stolen. Suddenly you feel a pain in your stomach. You visit a new hospital in your area but don't have your medical records on you. Not a problem, since projects like MedicalChain and Shivom are at forefront of the Medical Industry. Your medical records are produced in a jiffy, since they are stored on the blockchain and can be accessed anywhere, anytime by an authorized medical professional. 

And how can this individual be recognized as an authorized doctor? Well projects like Civic take care of this very problem by keeping a database of all people and their essential information, that are shared in collaboration with other projects to make life seamless. 

Cryptocurrency has many functions, and being a form of payment is just one of them. It is now the fundamental basis of our society, and we're all the better for it. Crime is low, the bridge between the rich and the poor have narrowed and humanity is now experiencing its most peaceful existence in history.

"I appreciate the polite engagement, and sorry for the delay...I was off the grid for our long weekend.

&gt; They have, at least for the past several years, been the gate keepers to the core repository and decided what PR's are worthy of notice.

I don't see the evidence for this.  [Here's a list of users with commit access.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/5riy1j/list_of_people_who_have_had_commit_access_to/)  It's from last year, so I'm open to receive any updates there.  But it looks to me like there have only ever been two different Blockstreamers with commit access, and never once has it been the lead maintainer.

And again, even if the client does get taken over by a group...it doesn't matter.  Anyone can fork the code and create an alternative, and no one can be forced to run code they don't like.

&gt; I think the better criticisms lie with the actual approach and (nonexistant) roadmap. The refusal to hardfork (as has been proven to be completely fucking safe by several other coins at the time) to a larger blocksize (even after many Core developers previously stating and even having such a proposal in the roadmap) produced a contentious hardfork that resulted in two coins (which was the boogeyman bullshit that was used as an excuse of not hardforking) which has hurt bitcoin overall.

Other coins have hardforked, but it hardly seems like an apt comparison, because their networks are only a tiny fraction of the size of Bitcoin's, so it is much easier to build consensus.  Even so, look at what happened with BCH...20% of full nodes were forked off the network, and that even includes some miners.

Aside from that, I can understand if someone disagreed with the decision not to hardfork a blocksize increase.  If someone says ""I think we should scale on-chain, so I prefer BCH"", then I can respect.  I think it's a poor decision, but I don't really have a problem with someone deciding that for themself.

&gt; The kicking the can down the road approach is perfectly valid when your 2nd layer is still not yet ready for mainstream use. There is now less utilization of the base layer than before but still extremely fucking terrible user experience with mempool spikes and resultant fees.

The mempool spikes and high fees are not ideal, I agree.  But if you want to accurately portray our position, it is worth mentioning that we see that as the lesser of two evils - the greater evil being the loss of decentralization by raising the cost of validating the chain (as well as other centralizing effects).

If you can understand that we don't think the increase in throughput is worth the negative effects, then it should be understandable how we would forgo a hardforked blocksize increase, even if 2nd layer tech isn't ready yet.

&gt; Bitcoin has now the lowest historical marketshare of the cryptospace as a direct fucking result of the absolute refusal to budge one fucking inch. If it had done so, there would not have been a split and neither would there have been a crashing of marketshare.

In order for me to agree that this is a valid argument, I'd need to be convinced of these two things:

- marketcap is an accurate measure of a coin's usefulness/success.
- the rise of altcoins wouldn't have happened without Bitcoin's blocksize debate.

I don't see any reason to believe either of those.  There are many utterly useless coins out there with multi-million dollar marketcaps that really skew those numbers.  And as long as the incentives are laid out for people to get rich off of launching their own coin, it seems to me that the rise of altcoins and ICOs was more or less inevitable.",1527044353

"Generally speaking, I agree with you. I think the IRS is a *slightly* different case insofar as I think they care about their reputation. I think that the ""shady underworld"" fears the IRS as the one organization that you can't get away from and you should tell the truth to, even when it's bad. If the IRS were going around reporting drug dealers to the FBI or DEA, then nobody would report their drug money and pay taxes on it. The IRS WANTS everyone to report their income and pay their taxes, so it would behoove them to make the reporting of and tax paying on crypto as accessible as possible. 

Obviously that is nothing short of a shit show right now, and you are correct in saying that the govt and banks don't want people adopting crypto. But, if does get big enough that it is clear there is no way of stopping it, OR (maybe) if enough people can kick them where it hurts (reporting a loss on their investment), they might be convinced that preserving their reputation of ""the ones not to be fucked with"" is in their best interest.

It is far more beneficial to those who currently hold economic power to use a centralized currency that can be directly manipulated and created.

"I don't know if he even 'declared' Gavin as a lead. That strikes me as counter-intuitive to what Satoshi was trying to accomplish. However, I recall that (from second hand sources / bitcointalk) a few things, which I was trying to re-verify what I recall. If my memory and the source was correct:

1) There were no more than three people that had access to an alert system that was built within Bitcoin, but was eventually removed. Gavin was one of the people that had access to this alert system. 

2) The Bitcoin software was not originally on a version control hub, but Gavin eventually set that up. I looked into the Github to see if there was history there, but I am not sure Github was even the first version control system used, nor was there a clear history who was involved that early that I could find. I mean, it seems to be there, but did not look easy to extract.

3) There was a lot of hearsay that Satoshi left after Gavin went to the CIA, but now that I look into it, his disappearance seems more closely aligned with the Wikileaks accepting Bitcoin announcement. At least his public messages seemed to stop. Maybe someone sees something different? 

Again, I don't think Satoshi would have declared Gavin to be the king of the code, but he might have just left him to be the only one with ""keys."" Gavin did make many commits early on and seems to be very humble. One of his first acts was to distribute the commit access. Again, don't take my word for it. It would be great to find a more direct source on these thoughts.

"I think you're confused by what a run on the bank is. Banks use what is called fractional reserve lending. Basically they only have a small amount of customer deposits as cash at any given time, enough to cover their expected withdrawals in excess of expected new deposits. The rest is loaned out to other customers. This means that if everyone tries to withdraw their money from the bank at once then they'll find that the bank doesn't actually have their money. FDIC insurance offers to cover deposits up to $250k in that case.

If you have your bitcoin in your own wallet there is no bank, just as there isn't if you have gold bars under your bed. You don't need FDIC insurance for your gold bars under your bed because everyone won't come to your bed trying to withdraw their share of your gold bars under your bed because that's not a thing.

The fact that FDIC insurance is even a thing is evidence of a problem with the banking system, that it's run on trust that deposits will be available when you need them, even though you know rationally that that simply cannot be true for everyone.

None of that applies to bitcoin. It's good that bitcoin doesn't have FDIC insurance.

"""popular in japan"" is a myth that was perpetuated during the bullrun and seemingly is still around. Japan has harsh tax requirements for crypto. *any* purchases with crypto must, in theory, be declared on your tax returns. Nobody here uses crypto for this reason. Dont refer to the handful of people that spend a couple of monacoin in a maidcafe, or the BTC acceptance at bic camera. *nobody* is using crypto any more than any other country. 

crypto here is also taxed at the absolute highest means possible (the same as income tax)..to put it into perspective, forex traders pay a flat 20%. Crypto investment gains totally more than 40million yen will be taxed at 55% (45% on the return then a further 10% bill comes 2 years later).

Bitcoin becomes the only legal currency. Everything else is forbidden by law.

People buy things as quickly as they can because physical things have a 'standard' value and bitcoin does not.

The incentive to mine BTC is always there in the form of both BTC fees and block reward. Eventually, just fees. But remember, the difficulty is adjusted. So if it isn't worth it, people stop doing it until the difficulty drops enough that is is worth it again. Hopefully it serves it's problem and reduces the wasted electricity.

"My argument is, most of the people only will use crypto when they can make a profit. And the profit must be noticeable, that the users really feel that crypto is an improvement of their financial situation. If you are poor, than every cent counts. It's easy to write, with an Apple X in your hand, BCH is created for the poor in Africa or Asia. But than most of the people forget the practical implementation. For a trusted payment, the customer need a connection to the network for make a payment, and the merchant need a connection to the network for control there was a payment. The poor people go to the market. How can they pay in BCH? Outside the big cities, you are already very lucky when you can find a GSM/Edge network. Maybe the customer can give the merchant a paper wallet. But what is than advantage if you compare with cash? Nobody will accept paper wallet as payment if there is cash. And imagine that the people have a phone, and a wallet, and BCH, and data/SMS connection,they only will use it if the price is cheaper than what they have to pay in FIAT. They never will use it, when they have to pay even 1 cent more than FIAT price. And my opinion is than, use the BCH marketing budget for help these people to use crypto. Why pay an pizza restaurant in Europe or USA some BCH if they will accept BCH. Better invest this money to create a payment provider, who create the same, or best, a cheaper price, than FIAT. Or invest the marketing budget in technology for the poor, the extremely cheap smartphone, or free communications provider. I wish to send money to my friend in Manilla. When you use Western Union, you pay a large fee, but the person goes in a office, only need ID card, and have the cash. I can teach them, buy a smartphone, take data coverage, install a BCH wallet, and than I can send BCH, no Western Union fee. Problem for my friend, nobody accept BCH for payments. Than they have to exchange to Pesos, but they have no bankaccount. And they can not open a bank account. What you think they say? The answer is, pls use Western Union.

"A young and in love couple decides to make a rather explicit and kinky sex video. They decide just for fun to upload it to a video site where the content is paid in micro\-transactions for each view. What started as just a fun kinky thing slowly turns into one of the most popular and most viewed adult videos on the site earning the couple thousands of dollars a month. The video is extremely explicit and features a specific kink that many would be fearful of sharing and the money is instantly split to each of their crypto accounts upon each view.

The couple, months down the line, finally break up and have to decide what to do with the video.  At this time the video is still making large amounts of money bu the man insists they take it down as he has started a new relationship with a woman who is says she cannot be with him if he won't remove the video. A woman he feels is the one.

The man being so in love with this new woman and feeling he wants to marry her eventually takes his ex\-girlfriend to court for the removal of this video, but the problem is the video has worth. It produces income which they have both been splitting since it's inception. 

In a first of it's kind case, and because the video had become virtually world famous in the adult entertainment world, the media grabs a hold of this story and runs with it. It's all over the news ""Man sues ex\-girlfriend for removal of million dollar sex tape!""

Now because of the media frenzy the video is getting even more views and more traffic and producing an insane amount of more money for the original couple.

The trial goes on for weeks and eventually the jury decides that since they both originally agreed to upload it, and the video now has value, if one party wants to remove it, thus removing the value, they can only do so by buying out the other party.

At this time because of the media frenzy and the estimated worth of revenue of the video's entire future lifetime the jury concludes the buy out price to be higher than the man could ever afford.

On one hand this video will continue to pay him for the rest of his life, but on the other hand he ends up losing the love of his life, the new girlfriend, whom can not bare to be with someone that has such an explicit past that the whole world has access to. She cannot, and will not marry into that.",1527039755

"&gt;There are many reasons people have to recover wallets. This is just one of them.
&gt;    

Right, that reason is to access newly created tokens that are the result of a hard fork. These tokens are called Bitcoin Cash. These tokens are not called Bitcoin. The Bitcoin tokens did not need to be recovered. For Bitcoin it was all business as usual. Two separate paths were not created on  August 1st, only one separate path was created. Bitcoin Cash forked away from the original chain.  Bitcoin remained Bitcoin on its original path aka original chain. Business as usual.    
Because these are separate tokens they have separate tickers. BCH is the ticker symbol representing Bitcoin Cash. BTC is the ticker symbol representing Bitcoin.  
Putting BCH next to the word Bitcoin is misleading because BCH is the ticker symbol representing Bitcoin Cash.   

&gt;Not saying it will happen, but if one day BTC stopped being mined altogether, and BCH became the only dominate fork, would it be strange to you if the community stopped adding the word Cash, and just started to call it Bitcoin?
&gt;     

It's reasonable to assume people are going to shorten or abbreviate long names. Hence the term Bcash. Bcash was not originally meant to be an insult or a slur. It was just an easier way to shorten Bitcoin Cash and to easily distinguish the two coins with the least amount of confusion.    
As long as Bitcoin exists, claiming they are both Bitcoin is a subjective / philosophical position to take. Not an objective one.     
You can say Bitcoin no longer follows Satoshi's vision or that Bitcoin Cash is the real Bitcoin all you want. The fact remains, it is objectively true that the same tokens I was using to pay my friends on July 25th was the same token on August 5th. That token is objectively Bitcoin.

The fund could also get bloated with money and politics as more and more teams ask and beg for shit.

At the end of the day, if majority of miners currently see that benevolently sacrificing some of the block reward for development is the best course of action in this crazy, free market ‘war’, that’s actually pretty fuckin badass.

"Ah well, sorry but I can't keep writing books about this every time someone asks. Suffice to say that deep state is very real, I'll name just few things that US government lied about and fabricated truths, which is deliberate propaganda and proves that US government is rotten to the core, and not just now but since its inception.

WWI - US entered that war because Jews (yes Jews) asked them to enter the war, so they can get their Jewish state, they paid the US (politicians and business people, bankers etc) money to do this.

WWII was continuation of WWI, this time US bankers and capitalists funded Nazi Germany, in order to fight rise of Communism (as it is threat to capitalist system same way Bitcoin is threat to banking system), US and GB bankers funded and capitalists traded with them, it was all just a good business.

Holocaust narrative is way exaggerated, they lied about numbers, they halved the numbers and it still doesn't look possible to have happened the way they claim, some people did tests on the so called gas chambers founding no residue of any chemicals, the mass graves are too small for number of people that they say are buried there... among few things .

JFK, they killed their own president

Northwoods - US government and CIA planned to kill US citizens and blame it on Cubans. JFK rejected... didn't live long after. His brother also killed, I wonder who could have killed him?

WWII - US knew about Japanese planning to attack Pearl Harbour but did noting. They wanted to be drawn into war, as again, Jews didn't get their Jewish state... and few other things.

If you look at all the nations that sided WITH Nazi Germany, you would see they are all monarchies and capitalist nations... yet no one in west is calling them shit?

Germany was very much hired army, as I said... to fight rise of Communism

Capitalists say how Communists killed 100 million people, yet all the casualties and famine that killed these people are caused by wars that capitalists and monarchs started, and US bankers funded.

No one went to jail for any of the funding of Nazi Germany or arming terrorists today, which US is still doing.

WMDs - how did that go? Lies ... all lies.

First gulf war - that girl that gave speech about how Iraqis killed babies... also a lie, she is daughter of Kuwait ambassador to US. Kuwait was drilling for oil in Iraq territory which is the real reason Iraq attacked (more like defended its national integrity). The US of course never mentioned that.

Vietnam war - against started on lies. 3 million people died because of it

WWII - 60 million people died... capitalists started that war

911 - gees, yet again US kills its own people and blames it on someone else, yet never attack Saudi Arabia even though all the alleged hijackers are Saudis and not single Iraqi or Afghan. US is best friend with Saudis... they sell them weapons... again... great business for certain capitalists.

Do I need to go on?

So like I said... you have no idea how deep the rabbit hole goes... and no, I am not wearing any tin foil hats... when you say shit like that, it shows that you are brainwashed.

"&gt; They don't sell fiat. They dont print it. They take it from 
&gt; person A and give it to person B. Then usually take it back 
&gt; from person B and give it to person C.

They don't ""give it"" to person B.    They have a pool of a large number of ""Person As""   who deposit currency.

Then the banks put all the money into a shared pool -- and say  they Owe each Person A  that person's account balance.

So the Bank has two things of interest:  The  Total of all  Person A  (depositors') account balances,   that is the Total of the Bank's obligations to depositors,   AND then  the  Pile of   Cash  or Bitcoin or Bitconnect or Whatever the bank is holding   to meet the obligation  to  allow their depositors' to withdraw any portion of that depositors' funds on demand.


Then the next step:   The  bank can spend some of the pool of  money,   so they  no longer have enough money on hand to pay all their depositors --- in the event of the theoretically possible but unlikely situation that a significant number of depositors come to the bank demanding to withdraw all their funds  over a short period of time:  the bank will  not be able to deliver,  since it spent some of the money.

The common situation then is to  spend  the depositors'  money to make new investments,   but to leave behind a small fraction, E.g.  10% of deposits as currency kept behind, that's the  ""Reserve"" in  Fractional reserve,   and the Fraction is the relatively small fraction of the depositors'  funds that are actually  not spent.

Oh,  And the typical way of spending or investing Depositors'  cash is to loan it to other  people who will use it to buy something ---  and typically the loaned money will find its way back as a deposit to the same bank.

Rarely does actual cash ever need to be delivered,  as electronic payments and checks are common ---- which are just numbers in banks' accounting systems.      But the totals in your accounts are unrelated to the totals of cash the banks' actually have on hand.

That's religious thinking. You can and should jump ship in the face of a colossal fuck-up like that. Preventing that from happening was as easy as slightly increasing the blocksize. They were warned for almost half a decade that that would happen but they're weak engineers so they weren't able to implement such a fix in time. Jump ship.

&gt;the people working on bitcoin view this as a LONG TERM PROJECT. 

The market doesn't sit on its hands and wait for the Bitcoin devs to get their act together. Evolve or die.

&gt;you answered the question yourself. bitcoin and any crypto needs fees to sustain the network after block subsidy goes away, unless it shifts from deflationary to inflationary. 

Then why isn't BTC in trouble right now when we aren't paying $55+ dollar fees to use it anymore? The reason is because we don't need to be paying that much in fees for **decades** at least, and it's smarter anyway to amortize those costs over a greater number of transactions than requiring a small number of users and transactions to shoulder the costs of the network. But I've said this already.

&gt;at this rate, bch would be in trouble because if you look at the blocks they have less than 100 transactions in them, and the size of your ""big blocks"" are less than 100KB

"&gt;Why do you think miners wouldn't gather more in fees from BTC than they would from a perpetually ~0 cost to use blockchain that aims to maintain capacity always greater than demand, like BCH?

That's easy. Because Core has crippled onchain tx's to a measly 3x/s. That's nothing and will forever prohibit Bcore's growth and therefore miner fees income which is also being siphoned away to LN.

The thing about consenting when A exchanges value with B neither agrees to the tax that goes to the pool of funds that get spent by the ""governing process"". 

Also, he seemed rather socialist in his approach saying because Dash has this tax Dash can pay higher salaries and attract better talent, and as a result, they will get better talent. 

MMMM... No, they will get better programmers (ones ignorant of the economics) in the short term. It's not better programmers that are needed. It's better investors. Someone has to give value to those coins paid to programmers. 

Bitcoin is not governed by developers, it's governed by economic incentives, the people who earn the most have the most at stake when it comes to funding development. BTC screwed up when the bankers started directing developers. It's the miners who have the incentive to fund development as they are paid in the coin they generate.  

BCH does not have a funding development problem, it has a problem with developers who want to get paid problem. 

Developers need to convince those who benefit from the code they write to pay them. I suggest the developers who have a funding problem go on strike. 

Also, I don't see the 6 month planned fork as a good thing. It gives unemployed developers too much control to change things without needing to get consensus from miners and industry who have blindly agreed to the upgrade path.

"You realize you're just trying make LN sound like a super advance technology, but here's a breakdown of what you just said.

1) Send BTC to get locked up in Lightening node.

2) In the event of a dispute, the winner takes all and the loser losses everything, like accidently syncing an old data.

3) Close channel and BTC gets broadcasted.

4) BTC queue in the mempool and compete with fee market to get confirmation.

You have added unnecessary steps and build a fee market for blockstream. Fees are for miners because they need to constantly upgrade their equipment and maintenance cost. Blockstream wants to get a piece of that fee without using much effort and maintenance cost, hence the additional fee in Lightening. There is no incentive to mine BTC in the future, you just need a cheap device to host a LN node and collect fees while having negligible electricity and storage cost due to the lack of Asics. Why pay 2k for a single Asic when you can set up 5 LN nodes for the same cost?

Well, this is how BCH works:
1) Send money to the mempool

2) Gets confirmed 10 minutes later regardless of the market fee as long as you pay 1 sat/byte.

There is no ""winner or loser takes all"" risk. It's literally you taking money from your wallet and giving it to someone. The only risk is that you stupidly send money to the wrong person.

The timelock exist in both BTC and BCH. In fact, BCH has enabled op_codes and incoming colored coins in November, making advance smart contract possible in BCH for the near future.",1527036171
"For me this was a must watch.

Many good parts comparing the contexts surrounding each coin, and the people involved, and analyzing the claims they make, and the levels of maturity and the thought that appear to be behind them...

Very suggestive also to think about what all of this means in this particular moment of history. That we may be part of a movement that will m something similar to a nation, , with this decentralized coin acting as grease of its economy. And the comparison with the declaration of independance of USA or any country, for that matter was also very provocative.

And the talk about governance models which is fascinating as a concept that in theory could substitute the role of the state in many cases.

But on the other side to see the tradeoffs to use a governance model in a coin, with a model like Dash, versus not having one in the protocol like Bitcoin doesn't have one, made it clear with the realization that in one side is a system supported by bureocracy on the social level, like the state, or the army, which is very inneficcient and doesn't encourage innovation very much, and it has a budget that has to be spent, versus a system based on a mining cartel, like the energy industry, communications industry, drug cartels... which are very efficient at providing scare resources, very professionals, very competitive between them, and very much encouraged to innovate.

So many insights and good moments. Thanks for sharing",1527036152
"Doubtful, I'll answer your question with another question, why do you like litecoin over bitcoin? Do you believe there can be more than one currency coin? My opinion is there can only be one and that bitcoin already has that by a enormous margin.",1527036146

Got back in early April and almost doubled my money within a couple weeks and instead of taking any money out, I reinvested them to just about break even point right now like a complete amateur.

In short, I'm almost 40 and on my way to early retirement anyway. Crypto was my ticket to retirement today. My own due dilligence tells me 2018 won't be like 2018 and its better to swing/snipe quick profits than depend on BTC. Too many moving parts for me.

So yes, the internet is worldwide. But, not everybody has access to It. Also, every country uses the internet for different sites, services, etc. Facebook is the leading social media service but people don’t like It, don’t use It, maybe never even heard of It.

For a lot of them it's not about gambling or speculative investment, it's about Bitcoin (despite its volatility) being a better place for them to store value than their constantly hyper inflating fiat currency run by a socialist government. Zimbabwe is banning banks from Bitcoin dealings for a similar reason, as people naturally don't want to store their value under the Zimbabwean dollar, despite the 'benevolence' of their government and central banks. 

I did happen to take economics in college, and somehow graduated without becoming a Keynesian or an SJW.

It only needs to wait 10 minutes at most to confirm, but nobody cares because it is as good as confirmed. Only btc users have to wait 6 conf cause their Network is insecure that only 6 confirmation is considered safe.

At least in speculation, with enough due diligence, some understanding of price action, portfolio diversification, and good ol risk management, you are more likely then not to find success.

In any case, there simply cannot be any justifications at this stage to say that one project is superior in every way to another. There are no details as to the full enterprise solutions being provided by either projects to their clients and the code for both projects are not yet open. Both now have similar goals (ven being late to the party tbh) in terms of becoming a full platform and ecosystem like eth and neo. There are differences in consensus and node reward models but there is not enough information for anyone to know whose tech is better at this stage, and there are advantages and disadvantages to either project's choice of these models.

You can see on the chart below, the red and green bubbles represent orders over 20 BTC being hit, lots of hidden orders becoming activated at 7950 once that 8K wall was removed.

https://i.imgur.com/cMZX9LA.png

Fairly low volume overall but it seems that this battle over 8K is getting plenty of large buyer support, BTC V&gt;5 orders have a positive ratio of 1.5 and the 1-5 BTC levels and V&lt;1 BTC levels are also positive.

https://i.imgur.com/qdxrBBu.png

In the past whenever we would come down to a support level and see the whales (V&gt;5 BTC) selling and the shrimp (V&lt;1 BTC) buying in hope of catching the bottom of the waves, it would break down lower and screw over the shrimp. Now its encouraging to see the buying support coming in from large volume buyers. It seems traders in general now see 7.8K as titanium support and are reacting in the way you would expect them to, with futures traders being very much in bulltardation mode, with futures premiums seemingly rising after dips. If you're a trader this is where you cover your short and take profit, around 7.9K or consider whether to long. But its basically nothing but air between 7.8 and 7.2 now so be very careful.

Personally I see no reason to change my long term views after concensus and I'll keep my exposure limited to 2 BTC until we reach much lower levels.

Happy gambling y'all",1527034291

Every so often there will be a circlejerk on either sub (&amp; on R/cryptocurrency) about how ‘x is the new stock, currency, or hold of value’. Once in a while there is a nice technical post summarizing updates or similar things. 

It’s ridiculous because neither of these subs and the communities they represent are willing to recognize their flaws. Crypto, bch, btc, etc, all of it comes with its flaws, but instead of a community effort to recognize and improve on those issues, the communities are filled with pointless circlejerking and hating on other cryptocurrencies.

China also is interested in blockchain and crypto they just don't like the decentralised aspect of it (because they like controlling everything), but again, they currently produce more Bitcoin than any other country, they would be stupid to ban it, rather than heaving taxing their miners and making a heavy profit.

And proportionately, relative to its population, Venezuelan demand is not tiny at all. 

But hey, if you're concerned and believe that central banks and governments can just spontaneously destroy Bitcoin or halt mining operations, perhaps investing in Bitcoin isn't for you.

"So you admit your control over the site is political in nature and not objective. 

Our fork is not going to need to remove stuff, we don't need censorship for a successful project. Au contraire, censorship does a lot of damage to it. 

You better pray to the Tethery gods that they keep the scam going, goes when Tether blows, Bitcoin-BTC is done. 

I hope you can get your coins exchanged for BCH on time when that happens and realize how much you have been bamboozled by fake bitcoiners that are trying to destroy the project by trying to make it the worse possible currency. 

The market, long term is not stupid. No utility means a low market price. Once all the fraud is purged, this will become the new norm because we will make it so.

"[https://etherscan.io/chart/address](https://etherscan.io/chart/address)

Wallet growth was strongly parabolic throughout 2015\-2017 and seems to be plateauing to a linear growth pattern in the past 6 months. Some things this might mean:

* Growth pace is still fast \(about 100,000 wallets a day since February 2018\) but it's stabilized and not getting faster.  In 2017, growth went from about 2,500/day in January to about 200,000/day in late December.
* Usage is spreading from population dense coastal and urban regions to less dense, rural regions. Google trends shows the US cities coasts gained interest in ETH much sooner than the rest of the country but that is no longer the case. 
* The early adopters wave is getting saturated. Since there are no dApps, we can assume most ETH wallet growth is coming from investors and traders. Growth from these users will plateau as that market saturates.  If we don't see mainstream adoption through the introduction of dApps, the investor/trader market will reach full saturation and growth will stagnate.

Some data that might be skewing these numbers:

* Wallet growth is a proxy for user growth but an imperfect one \- some users have just 1\-2 wallets while others \(money launderers, especially\) have hundreds or thousands. We might just be witnessing a deceleration of the latter type of wallet use.
*  Crypto exchanges might additionally create more duplicate wallets and burner wallets than their user numbers indicate.",1527032538

"&gt;BTC has 200k daily TX now. 


Not true, daily txs are &gt;300k.

&gt;Last time with 300k TX, fees shot up to $60!

Fees shot up only in part because of high txs. A big component of that was USD price, which was more than double the current price. Comparatively, those fees are today ~$25, if not less. 




&gt;When LTC got to 100k TXs, fees went up to 60cents.

What do you think will happen if BCH ever gets to that many txs??




&gt;You guys need to figure out this blocksize problem of yours. Or figure out a way around it. LN is not working. Yes, I tried LN last week to see the other side's point, but $1.62 to deposit funds, then anothr $10 to open channel... wtf. 

This is BS. Current fees are extremely low.



&gt;Guessing another set of fees to close channel and withdraw funds? 

Again, fees &lt;$1 are pretty common now.


&gt;Meanwhile, the rest of the crypto world just hit 'send' from their own wallets.


Of course, nobody uses them... The same as it was with Bitcoin ~4yrs ago.

&gt;BCH and BTC community should stop arguing and try each other's products. Arguing is a waste of time. BCH peeps should try LN and BTC peeps should try cointext. So they can choose which is best for them, store value or actual usage.

"&gt; with a variety of usability issues

yes, there are usability issues, so it's only a partial solution

&gt; you have to always be online

no, only if you receive money you should, like when you expect to be paid. there are various levels of intermediate nodes to relax that rule, but that would reduce security.

&gt;  lightning hubs could be subjected to KYC laws

you could say same about like every node and miner ever, and anybody can create these LN nodes and routing can go through ANY nodes you want making it a non issue.

messages are not even clear text except end to end w/ onion routing magic:

&gt; Sphinx shares similarities with the well-known anonymizing communication tool, Tor (the Onion Router). As with Tor, any data package sent with Sphinx — including the receiving IP address – is encrypted. This encrypted package is then itself encrypted a couple times over until it consists of several “layers” of encryption (hence the “onion” metaphor for Tor).

&gt; Using clever cryptographic tricks, all these layers of encryption are applied so that each intermediary along a route toward the final destination of the package can unwrap only one layer. This layer reveals to each intermediary where the package must be forwarded to, but nothing else. (Compared to Tor, Sphinx uses improved cryptographic algorithms and creates a constant-size data package to better obfuscate a node’s position in the route.)

&gt; I hate the direction the Core team took it in.

I hate some aspects of core team direction, but core team isn't the multiple LN teams who built it into what it is today, and it's quite good tech with insane scalability and actually provides incentives to run those nodes you call hubs for some reason.

see: https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/69q120/eli5_why_do_people_think_lightning_network_will/

gold only makes sense in one layer - absolute most security it can have like it's a metal, but far easier to ship. there's sidechain and ln layers too and above.

you always have tradeoffs, and bitcoin core chose not to compromise on security on layer 1 and thus force everyone to downgrade, but rather provide a choice. I like layer 1 scaling too, you don't have to not like it, but why does it have to be on bitcoin, there are obviously issues with it too from basic math and knowledge bandwidth is a limited resource. If blockchain #1 goal is to be secure through decentralization, it's not an objectively better design to give it up for something else when there are options.

Anything specific of what I said you dislike? I don't read r/bitcoin on purpose for many years now for same reason i don't visit eth subreddits - censorship and single mindedness is gross.

From what I can tell there have been actual audits of the XMR codebase and their privacy is sound.

Right now the best way to do BCH=&gt;XMR=&gt;BCH is shapeshift, but they keep public records, so the only way to keep your transaction private is to do BCH=&gt;XMR =(non-shapeshift-transfer)=&gt;XMR=&gt;BCH.

They have a (better, more private) xmr.to site setup to make converting XMR to BTC even easier. A good start to bolster privacy for BCH would be setting up an equivalent of xmr.to that converts to BCH instead of BTC to get around the privacy issues with shapeshift and similar sites.

Tell your employer that you'll accept a 10% paycut if paid in BTC.

"&gt;i don't disagree that, particularly with bitcoin, there's no way to enforce full reserves, nonetheless i would expect the masses to perceive this as fraud

I mean its only fraud if they claim to keep full reserves.

Given how little people care that Tether has never had an audit despite claiming it would get regular audits and claiming it has a full reserve, it doesn't seem the crypto masses seem to care particularly whether their exchanges are backed by full reserves given how many are trading on exchanges that are trading in Tether.

&gt;i would expect the masses to perceive this as fraud and bank runs to put those frauds out of business and the system to be deemed fully reserved even if people fraudulently purport be fully reserved while in reality they are not.

Why have such confidence?

Fractional reserve banks were going for hundreds of years, most of that time when currency was expected to have some metal backing it. There was nothing stopping people from running full reserve banks, they're just terribly uncompetitive compared to fractional reserve banks so few people used or tried to set one up. 

Without fractional reserves banks make far less money, which means they charge higher fees and don't give out interest (since they can't lend your money out to make money on it), and realistically maybe 1 customer in 10,000 cares enough about a once in a century risk of a bank run enough to pay higher fees for 50 years.

The only thing stopping fractional reserves from existing is government regulation, otherwise you can always write a contract saying ""yes you can loan my money out to people in return for interest"". although with hardcore rothbardian types easing of regulations on fractional reserves is ironically seen as some sort of government imposition on sound money.

There's no reason Bitcoin won't have just as many fractional reserves as Gold, or just as many runs as gold fractional reserves did. more so in absence of a central authority to help bail out those reserves . Although I would imagine there's probably going to be more fraud since places won't want to advertise as fractional reserve given the crypto crowds aversion to, but competitive market forces will drive reserves to become fractional.

"It's hard seeing what a contest this has turned into. We should be championing adoption, whether BTC, BCH or anything else. Instead it's a bunch of ad hominem attacks and shadenfreude over perceived failings. It's a bit ridiculous and distracting from the overall goal. ",1527029068

We really **are** Bitcoin fans.  Just not the same version as discussed on r/bitcoin.

And... Have you been to r/bch?  It is run by someone who dislikes BCH.

",1527028783
"Or perhaps not overreact like a pussy and assume an Italian economic issue will crash the world market. Crypto is considered a risky investment, people take their money out when the market doesn't do well and only invest when their base investment is doing well. Why the fuck do I even bother explaining it to a dumbshit like this? You'll probably lose it all on questionable decisions anyway. ",1527028781
"Dont worry, Fiat wont survive the next few years. We should all be using crypto by then. Pref BCH.

The average life expectancy for a fiat currency (based on history) is 27 years. Every 30-40 years the reigning monetary system fails and has to be retooled. It technically started on 1913 and retooled in 1944, and was retooled again on 1971 (Nixon), because it was about to fail.

our lovely fiat is over 46 yrs old. It is way passed due. And no amount of retooling will fix it since Satoshi unleashed the idea of Decentralized Currency to world.

I don't think we are going to be able to fix that problem and it is **HUGE** and growing daily.  It is not a bitcoin thing, it is a cultural thing.  Somehow the world is turning anti-intellectual and we are getting bizarre results.

My favourite example is the sudden increase of people who believe the world is flat now, one of my guilty pleasures is to watch ""flat earther"" videos on youtube so I can scream at the people (I make sure I am home alone first) :D.

"That essay reiterates that the initial price pumps were due to speculation. The end goal is to create widespread demand so you can actually use BTC regularly. If adoption takes hold then there wont be such wild price swings and pump and dumps. There will be more incentive to spend instead of just hold. 

But ultimately it's still demand that gives something price, not holding. If the holders run out of fiat to buy BTC, and no merchants accept BTC, then it's got 0 demand and thus not worth anything.  ",1527028702
"I'm not invested in a supply chain crypto, I'm invested in a platform that does supply chain things (along with fintech, smart city, real estate, agriculture, green energy, automobile history, insurance, and digital content ownership things)

I used to have some WTC, but I sold for a lot of reasons. Too many red flags. I don't feel like listing them all here but the biggest one for me is this... the WTC community uses this ""that's just China for you"" sort of excuse whenever WTC does something questionable or makes some faux pas and embarasases themselves, right? 

""It's a different culture, we westerners can't begin to understand how it works"" right? But the thing is - NO ONE IN CHINA KNOWS WHO WALTON IS OR WHAT THEY'RE DOING

95% of WTC's volume (both social and market volume) comes from the West, and for some reason that's okay for a Chinese coin with partnerships exclusively in China. And we're just not gunna worry about it and pretend everything is perfectly fine. 

Also, most of their 200 employees are factory workers. Just saying",1527028679
Why *not* BCH? It’s the obvious choice if you were impressed by bitcoin ,1527028672
"Why are you interested in sub 1c coins? The numeric value is just an artifact of the total circulation. For example, Bitcoin is divided into 100 million Satoshi per BTC, and all internal calculations in the BTC mining code and blockchain are done in Satoshi. You could even make the argument that the cryptocurrency is actually Satoshis and we call arbitrary groups of them Bitcoins. They are currently selling for 0.008 cents. ",1527028669
"I won't fud you VeChain, but I will tell you that Ambrosus could be the next big supply chain crypto. Its worth looking into. Great team and partnership to be announced soon, check it out for yourself.",1527028616
"This was the same as around October 2017 though. There were nothing but good news like Amex and other big players jumpinng in, but everything tanked (except for bitcoin). The market will price in all these news in one go when they engage the next bullrun. My opinion, I'm sure many would disagree.",1527028606
Bitcoin would be higher and closer to global adoption,1527028569
"I tried depositing funds in both, but only blockpress accepted my funds. 

I know memo is still in alpha, but it has competition now. But I do hope both projects succeed. Im using FB, Twitter and reddit at the same time, no reason why I cant use both blockpress and memo too.

PS. Just got banned from twitter, and a bunch of FB groups for mentioning BCH. And Im pretty sure I'll get censored from r/bitcoin and r/cryptocurrency too if I mention BCH.

He is also ambiguous in places, so I could selectively pick parts of his text to suit my arguments as anyone else can. The whitepaper was a descriptive introduction to the concept. The Bitcoin client is was the empirical implementation of the concept. Citing a whitepaper and ignoring the actual software is a fools errand.

I don't know what bad actors are going to do on the network in future.

There's always going to be a dip. In January, people would have called an idiot for selling Nano at $10 before it touched $30. But how many of those actually sold at $30?  The truth most of them hodled and watched it go down. In the long term, had you sold, you would have been in profit, as recently it struggled to touch $10, even when BTC was close to 10K.

"XRPs are required in order to enforce transaction fees. Payment spam needs to be prevented somehow, either with transaction fees or proof\-of\-something. There's no ""central currency"" to use.

Ripple is, per concept, deflationary. Fees are not given to block validators, instead they're burned and gone forever. Because of this, most of the coins are in a vault to be released over time by the Foundation, where they can't be accessed or traded. If they were to assign any of these coins to themselves, Ripple would immediately become worthless \(market is about supply and demand; who demands for a coin that's getting duplicated?\), similarly to how another currency would become worthless after a 100&amp;#37; breach. It would essentially mean the end of the foundation, but quickly a competitor would pop up and continue the network from the last uncompromised snapshot.

Now, of course that doesn't fit the mindset of the blind ""we need decentralization"" crypto\-anarchist. You essentially need to trust a company, but in their own favor they want to keep the network up. That is the reason why Ripple is often despised; you still have to trust someone, who's essentially profiting from you, too, though.

Also had a friend send bitcoin to bitcoin cash address. So about half of people I know have been victims of a clear fraud. It wasn’t much money but i feel sorry and a bit embarrassed. So it’s frustrating seeing an altcoin pretend to be bitcoin openly and as part of its marketing. It’s a shame. More needs done to prevent this. Market it as a better bitcoin but not bitcoin.

"If they're issuing it, they still own it.

The reason Bitcoin works so well is that there's trustless cooperation between independent (often antagonistic) actors who secure the blockchain and keep everything fair.

A good way to think of it would be a Bitcoin where a single person or organisation confirmed transactions exclusively, and only they could edit and update the ledger. If we imagine this is the government, they would have instant access to all of the transactions of all of the users/addresses on the network and so could not only veto transactions they do not approve of, but they can also go back and rewrite past transactions to drain all of an addresses funds to another which they own.

This is one of the greatest dangers we face in the near-term.

Governments will naturally opt for the version of crypto that they can control over the one they can't, and if that happens we go from distributed-trust of the current system (where we trust banks, banking systems, and the government) to one of almost absolute trust in the government.

I guess amazon is out of the question, but something Rakuten-level or even bol.com/coolblue-level would really set things in motion. Unfortunately nowadays it's even harder, because there's 1000 shitcoins out there, and if any big company is going to ""adopt"" crypto, it's going to be driven by a low-to-middle manager, who accumulated and wants a pump (I suspect something of the sort happened with IBM and Bosch, can't be sure though).

3. Craig Wright has been mentioning Oracles but I can't seem to find anything that's in the works. I think we're missing out on being the first to solve a problem that hinders crypto adoption.

"I'm not saying anybody is trying to push the max coin supply, I'm saying that a collaborating group of miners *could* increase the supply, if they are the only first-class citizens of the network.

I don't think it's a good argument to think ""they're not doing it now, so they'll never do it"". I'd rather it be baked into the consensus rules their inability to do it, as it currently is in Bitcoin - because attempting to do it would boot them off the network. The same won't be true if you don't have a large pool of spectating nodes tied to economic activity.

&gt; Yea I believe 2000 nodes is also kind of low but consider the more adoption there is, the more businesses and users there are and the more decentralization there will be because some of these will need to run nodes.

You're arguing that nobody needs to run nodes, but now you're saying that businesses will need to run nodes. Which is it?

Technically, nobody needs to run more than an SPV wallet, but by doing so, they are placing trust in a third-party to play honestly on the network where you want your economic activity to happen.

Nobody is going to run a fucking node if it costs then millions of dollars for server farms, if they're not generating revenue from doing so by mining. The idea that you're going to get more people running nodes is wishful thinking. That ~2000 is going to shrink.

I've mentioned many times before that I'm not a tiny-block fundamentalist. I think we have room for moderate block growth which won't significantly limit the ability for a common user to run a full node. I'd estimate this as probably around the 128MB in 5-10 years time, unless Moore's law begins accelerating. Gigabyte blocks are too big to propagate at low latency, verify and store without investing large amounts into sever infrastructure. At this point you're only going to have a handful of people running a node.",1527026704

You are being sold a lie that miners decide the rules of the network. Miners craft blocks according to consensus rules, and prevent double spending of coins in that network of users by putting in more PoW than dishonest miners.

But it’s not.. it’s hard to tell if the news is good but we’re just so over priced that it doesn’t matter. If we were at a 50 bill market cap I’d be buying a bunch but we aren’t. We are very high compared to 8 months ago and innovation hasn’t gone up in Those 8 months as much as the price has... so many people are afraid we are well over bought and looking at another dip down to 6-5k for BTC,1527025637

"&gt; Look at the distribution of btc by total wealth per person.

That's the thing about Bitcoin. You can't. Analyzing the addresses doesn't provide any clear picture. Many big addresses belong to exchanges in which the funds represent multiple users, some big addresses are lost coins from the early days. Additionally many users have their coins stored in multiple addresses so there may be people out there more wealthy with small amounts in several addresses than big amounts in one.

We really have no idea what the actual wealth allocation is of Bitcoin. ",1527025535
"If I made $100,000 worth of XVG right now and converted to BTC, that would drop the BTC/XVG ratio (it would not necessarily raise BTC/USD). If I cash out the BTC, then BTC/USD falls. Imagine I make $100,000 worth of XVG every hour and do this nonstop.

News travels slowly, so a lot of people will be unknowingly buying these hacked coins thinking they're ""buying the dip"" or getting some kind of discount. If the exchanges took action and suspended trading or delisted XVG altogether, they'd be protecting people from buying what will inevitably be bags and at the same time, they'd be preventing money from being drained out of the overall crypto market cap.",1527025527

"I could get behind this concept. Stop taking I terms of dollars, we should now price bitcoin as a value of pizzas. ",1527025045
"Exactly. Reserves in USD being inflationary fiat are not only held by the commercial bank itself but insured by the central bank in accounts registered to the commercial bank acting as a fractional reserve. FDIC is impossible with crypto reserves because the central bank cannot provide any support at all for a currency they do not control the creation of (new supply). Without FDIC, fractional reserves offered to commercial bank customers are not possible or legal. The only reason fractional reserve banking is even possible is because the central bank can and does guarantee the money supply of both hard currency and underwritten loans in all forms which the commercial bank writes to it's customers.. 

 The individual claiming the bitcoin supply can be inflated has no idea what they are talking about. It's literally only possible with inflationary fiat money controlled by (the) central bank providing oversight to a commercial bank.. As lender of last resort the central bank can *only* provide oversight to fiat currencies because they control (fiat).",1527025027
"&gt; so what they would run out of Bitcoin to sell?

Yes.  In very simple terms, if Coinbase has total account values of 10m BTC, but lends out 9M BTC at any given time, what happens when someone goes to withdraw 1.5M BTC?  They can't liquidate those loans, so what happens?

"&gt; The miners invested tons of money to do what they do. Did you? You and your fullnode don't have a skin in the game. 

I have a lot (80% of my net worth) invested in Bitcoin, but more importantly than that, I've invested most of my adult life developing technology which I think is necessary to have freedom and privacy preserving software, and I'm not going to sit idly when I see bad actors attacking the most important piece of technology ever created.

&gt; what I meant before is that miners have a financial incentive to remain honest. If they try to pull something funny, it will blow up in their face. 

It's important here is to define terms. What do you mean by ""honest?""

Miners might try to sell the idea that ""a deflationary currency is bad, we need some level of inflation"" as justification to print more Bitcoin. It doesn't actually matter if they're right, wrong, have good or bad intentions, they are ""honest"", because they are the only party which gets to decide what ""honest"" means and where every other entity in the system is merely a spectator.

In a system where entities can define what ""honest"" is, by passively running a node according to the rules of the network they operate on which is not attacking that network, then miners no longer get to decide what ""honest"" means.

&gt; wtf is this conspiracy? Thats the ""plan""?? by whom?? You throwing wild accusations right now without backing them up. Remove the tinfoil hat bro. 

It should be obvious that there are certain characters being put on pedestals in your community and pushing it in their desired direction. It's not your entire community, but when most of you are just spectators it doesn't matter. I think most people just believe the bullshit that big blocks can work without completely centralizing the network.

But I don't think the ringleaders think this. Particularly proven frauds who aren't stupid and know precisely what they are doing. Big blocks can only work by centralizing network resources. You aren't going to increase decentralization by making it more expensive to do so. (And you really *need* to increase decentralization if you think ~2000 nodes cannot be targetted by state-level actors).",1527024249

"&gt; Bitcoin search results have declined by 90% since the peak, whereas the price declined by 50%. 

I never said it was a perfect 1:1 match, I said it has the most predictive power, at least that I know of.

Try comparing the price with daily transactions, or nodes, or anything else and see how accurately it matches the rise and fall in price.

&gt; I also note that between Mar 2015 and Oct 2016, the Bitcoin price tripled yet search volume remained the same.

You can also note times when the price went up 10x despite no other factor apart from search traffic having a significant increase. 

you'll also note that right after that time period you mentioned ended, search and price start picking up together.

Once speculative interest started picking up again, that 3x increase in value went into a 19x increase in value, proving again that the majority of price increase correlates with speculation, not underlying performance metrics. Performance was going to shit that entire time, but it didn't correlate with price because to speculators the only performance that matters is price.

Using Bitcoin at the cost of significantly higher fees, much slower confirmation times, the enormous amount of wasted energy to achieve 3-7 transactions per second and the increased inconvenience of managing your own keys, isn't enough to convince me or really most people that it will be used for mass adoption. I know all the counter-arguments of ""lightning will fix this"", ""but freedom"" and ""all the energy used would otherwise be wasted"", but I'm not convinced.

"&gt;A soft-fork is not an ""attack"", because old clients still treat the transactions and blocks as valid, they just can't understand whatever features have changed in the upgrade, but that doesn't matter, since they won't be using those features until they upgrade.

To be clear, I don't think that soft forks *are* attacks. Rather that they include what is, in effect, an attack on anyone trying to remain behind on the old rule set. Consider the converse and note that ""51% attacks"" are really just malicious soft forks. What are all of the bad things that a malicious entity with a majority of the hash power can do? Well, they can facilitate double spends. But that's equivalent to a soft fork that begins to enforce the following rule: ""*actually* transaction B came before transaction A."" They can freeze out other miners: ""only the blocks that I mine are valid."" They can blacklist addresses: ""tx's from the following addresses are invalid."" They can even shut down transaction processing entirely(!): ""in order to be valid, a block must be completely empty."" You're thinking about soft forks that, from your perspective, simply add a new, optional-to-use transaction type and asking how that can be considered to include a ""51% attack.""  Well because you might think that the protocol change is a harmful one and prefer to use a chain that doesn't include it. But in order to do so and avoid being swept along with the (in-your-eyes) harmful change, you'll need to coordinate your own fork.

&gt;In the case that a hash rate majority attempt a hard fork, they only hard fork themselves away from the chain economic activity. 

Well no, that's only likely to be the case in a bizarre scenario where the hash rate majority makes some obviously-malicious change via hard fork (e.g., lifting the 21 million coin supply cap). And a malicious hash rate majority is very unlikely to attack the chain via a hard fork given that a soft fork attack is so much more devastating. But if we assume the incentive system that is the heart of the Bitcoin invention is working properly, the hash rate majority should only be attempting to mine a chain (or chains) with features that they think investors want. And in general, there IS a very strong incentive for users to rush to follow the miners given the strength of the most-PoW chain as a Schelling point and the overwhelming importance of the network effect.

&gt;Miners would not attempt to hard fork without also attempting a social attack to convince users to convert to their chain. This is basically what Bitcoin Cash is.

This strikes me as a strange interpretation of events.  If miners think a particular course of action is in Bitcoin's best interests, then it makes sense for them to try to convince other investors that's the case. I see the BTC chain as being the victim of a ""creeping 51% attack."" Obviously if tomorrow a majority of the BTC hashrate began orphaning any blocks larger than 1-kb, thereby rendering the network essentially unusable, we would rightly identify that as a ""51% attack."" Well, keeping the 1-MB limit in place as it becomes increasingly inadequate in the face of rising transactional demand ultimately gets you to the same place. 

&gt;If miners attempted a 51% attack, the worst damage they could do is double-spend some transactions of people who didn't wait for multiple confirmations, and cause some minor denial of service by mining for example, empty blocks. 

If miners attempted a 51% attack, the worst damage they could do would completely destroy the market's confidence in, and the usability of, the chain they attacked. The relatively modest ""creeping 51% attack"" on BTC already produced a pretty nasty situation in December with really ugly persistent backlogs and average tx fees that spiked briefly to over $50.  If the hash rate majority decided to *really* attack that chain via repeated reorgs and/or empty-block attacks, they could effectively kill it pretty damn quickly. 

&gt; but it's clear from Bitcoin Cash that social attacks are not the most effective way on-board a majority of users - it doesn't matter if you're right or wrong about which chain to move to if you can't get the support of the majority.

Again, I think that calling Bitcoin Cash a ""social attack"" is silly. I see it as a desperate attempt to route around the social attack the BTC is falling victim to. But it's certainly far from ideal and represents, in my eyes, at least a partial failure of the incentive system. The mining majority should have done a clean upgrade of Bitcoin network to increase its capacity. Instead, we got a rebranded hash-rate minority ""spinoff"" that was forced to make wallet-breaking changes to its transaction format and DAA, essentially forcing that chain to restart its commercial network effect from scratch. BCH by the very nature of how it was created was put at a HUGE disadvantage relative to the incumbent chain.

2. Sound money can be co-opted.  This is what happened to gold. Interests will attempt to go after the weakest link. The weakest thing a currency can have is a leader. Bitcoin doesn't have that.

3. Bitcoin has a more credible commitment to not raising the 21M cap. We have already had blocks with more fees than block subsidy. BCH may have to raise the cap if they want to attract hashpower after the block subsidy gets really small and goes away.

4. Gold didn't need a marketing team. Bitcoin does well without a marketing team. How will BCH do without theirs?

5. When people held gold, they didn't have to worry about gold losing it's value by a new metal coming along.

Crypto is only ""very transparent"" if it is reasonable for anyone to audit the block chain, but you can do the calculations and quickly work out that it's going to be extremely expensive to run the supercomputer required when blocks are gigabyte sizes, as will be expected if there is global adoption.

You claimed in your previous post, that apparently, non-mining nodes have no power, so if miners wan't to change the rules, they have nobody who can stop them, right? This is only true when non-mining nodes are so few that miners can ignore them.

Well that's the fucking plan. Remove the ability for the vast majority of people to run a node, then it becomes trivial for miners to push the network in whatever direction they want without even asking the majority of network users, because there is nobody who can stop them when all you have are non-valiidating clients which *depend* on the miners to operate honestly, but can't actually hold them to account.

In a system where mining nodes are a minority of nodes, the rest of the nodes hold miners to account, by rejecting bad blocks and forcing dishonest miners off the network.

"The problem is that most of the people don't really know or understand why Bitcoin is consuming energy and what that energy means for Bitcoin. Feels like that even here in crypto side of reddit most of the people are totally clueless about it and I can only image how it's in general public.

I'm too tired to write good explanation, but in nutshell, why Bitcoin is really consuming energy is to secure network, not to do transactions. All Bitcoin really needs to do transactions is a two computers who runs the software \(well we could go by even with one computer, but that wouldn't be much of a network then\). That could deliver easily current transaction speeds and much more. However, to fuck up the network is now only needed three computers \(or just two more powerful\). But because you get more bitcoins from successfully getting right answer to a cryptographical algorithm, people throw more computing power to them and difficulty of the algorithm is adjusted automatically to keep blocks appearing on same 10min rate on average. Because of that, the energy Bitcoin consumes follows slowly its price. Because of that, you need to waste energy usage of Ireland \(\+ all the equipment, which probably means several billions even in scenario where you get them by manufacturing costs\) if you want to do something shady, like 51&amp;#37; attack \(assuming none of the current hashpower is yours\).

So while clueless people are thinking ""oh damn, Bitcoin is using energy of Ireland to do 3 transactions per second"", developers are thinking ""Great, Bitcoin is getting even more harder to crack"".",1527021604

Litecoin, yes I think you are right they do want to be the ""cash"" coin but lets face it, Charlie Lee is borderline autistic, LTC's own creator does not believe in it enough to hold it even. LTC actually is pretty good just like BTC, as long as not too many people use it, then they may refuse to scale just like BTC is doing.

It was like that at the fork, and it hasnt changed one bit since then.

And just because you dont like what bitcoin is, does that make what you like bitcoin instead. Its like claiming the original icecream recipe was vanilla.

I.e. Bank \(coinbase\) gives out actual currency \(Bitcoin\) as a loan, but still guarantees the depositor will be able to withdraw / spend as much currency \(Bitcoin\) as he/she deposited.

There just wont be a way to print Bitcoin to inject liquidity into the economy if needed. The rest could work like regular fiat systems.",1527021130

One of them is paytomat, the thing i like it is Extension for POS\-terminals, gives an opportunity to pay for crypto\-currency. Follow them for quite a long time. The project inspires hope. boys have reliable partners such as SONM, NEM, Hacken.",1527019078
"I just have a couple gripes, being a relatively big Bitcoin Cash user:               


1. There are not enough paths to purchase, and easily. I don't care how everyone uses Coinbase ""just fine"". I don't care how some people find it easy to buy from bitcoin.com (it isn't easy enough when I try it, the website still says Bitcoin Core). I don't like being forced to choose from one or two routes that include scanning your ID and photograph and address and everything. That doesn't sound permissionless, at all.       


2. There needs to be more investment into ecosystem projects. I don't like how there is just a couple of groups (is there even more than one?) funding a few things, it's great to see the miners signaling their intent to help fund development and perhaps even ecosystem developers, but /r/btc should at least have a 'funding friday' or something like that. New projects will have more incentive to dive in if they knew they could get paid right away.                       


3. There's not enough educational material, people are still confused how the whitepaper exactly works. Its only 8 pages. Yet its been so many years, /r/btc should've picked through the thing with a fine-tooth comb by now and offered a comprehensive, easy to understand document or guide of some kind. If you want to respect and appreciate Bitcoin Cash one really needs to grasp the whitepaper, it is not some religious document, it is a technical engineering design document. It is easy enough to point people to the whitepaper, and I understand people that want to learn, will... but we should do what we can to make it easier for newcomers who may already be bombarded with ICO whitepapers.       


4. It's not just about merchant adoption accepting BCH, merchants should also be connecting with each other and using BCH, there is an initiative http://acceptbitcoin.cash but I feel like a tool that merchants can use to automatically send information to their suppliers would do wonders for adoption.

"My BCH payment would be just as theoretical as a LN payment at this point - as in Im not using either.

but to address you statement seriously: As I said before 0conf is a structural problem, whereas LNs problems have been coding errors and are being fixed. 

Arguing against LNs structure is a philosophical debate, vs 0conf abuse is a fact.

&gt; What? How many cases of BCH double spending have happened?
Plenty of double spends have happened on BTC - for example Peter Todds double-spend on Coinbase. BCH has no technology to prevent this same attack BY DESIGN!",1527018971
"Fluffy is a watch enthusiast and was already  rich before crypto. I don't know him personally but I really don't have the impression that crypto (and how he might financially benefit from it) has changed him in any way. This is a guy who does what he wants to do and does not care what others think about him, no matter if it's Fluffy pony shirts or expensive watches he is wearing. He really doesn't seem to be the type who needs to impress others for the sake of his ego. ",1527018951

"If Bitcoin cannot scale to meet global demand, where every human on the planet can conduct hundreds or more transactions per day, and there are not at least *millions* of full nodes in the network, then project has ultimately failed and we'll end up with an amalgamation of partially centralized shitcoins.

In order to meet the demand for global scale, without risking centralization, we need far better technology than currently exists. So far LN is the most promising technology because it can make Bitcoin scale by several orders of magnitude, as opposed to other approaches like linearly scaling the block-size, which also reduces the network decentralization.

If there are only a few thousand, or even a few tens of thousand nodes running, that would not be resilient to a concerted effort by several governments working together to shut down or put the network under their control. Bitcoin literally needs millions of people running nodes for it to be an impossibility for governments to even consider trying to clamp down on it.",1527018864
"1) Bitcoin Cash is not a scam. That is a verifiable fact! Keep claiming it just portrays you as an idiot. 
2) Bcash is the name of a node implementation of Bitcoin Cash. Deal with it. Sucker. 
3) Since 1 &amp; 2 applies - Twitter is just exercising censorship, plain and simple and hence is just a shit service, that doesn't deserve customers or ad revenue. They can go fuck themselves, sideways and back and forth. ",1527018853

With institutional investors soon to be coming in, I'm wondering if they may not choose to invest in bitcoin but rather go with the other currencies that have fiat pairings and better use case.

"Being a digital currency is the first and maybe most straight forward application of decentralized block chain technology and bitcoin showed the way. That's an undeniable real world use case there (unlike many of the newer, sometimes exotic projects where you have to wonder is block chain really is a good solution for the problem they want to solve).
So there's certainly a demand for a cryptocurrency and the impressive rise of Bitcoin reflects that. However, Bitcoin became less and less useful as an actual currency with its slow transaction times and high fees (especially around January, now not any more). So this opened a window of opportunity to fill the space and Nano is a perfect fit with its impressively fast and feeless transaction and easy use. Nano is a ready product, not work-in-progress like many other cryptos (some of them. With obscenely high market caps). So there's a big potential there. 
Major adoption would drive the price, just like it did for bitcoin back in the day (not talking about the speculation-driven ATH spike) and I think this is what investors are hoping for.

- BTC crashing, a ton of BTC money was pumping into other coins (notice how everything else pumped in January while BTC dropped)

- Here comes RaiBlocks.  Instant transactions without fees.  Tiny cap, distribution through faucets in 3rd world countries.  Without miners!  Green.  Breakthrough tech.

I understand the concerns with USDT. I have personally used it and had no issues yet but if some of what they say about it is true it could all collapse instantly and hopefully I wont be holding it at the time. What I don't understand is some people claim it has no use even if it was legit. The only reasons I have used it is to day trade or more accurately make trades in attempts to make some type of gain. For example selling say bitcoin at a high then buying it back at a low and using USDT as the currency to hold my money so it does not change in value. Its quick and easy plus the way I see it in my opinion it should not be a taxable event. I could be wrong and even if I'm right the government may not care and still come for that money but I think you have an argument with converting to USDT as being a not taxable event vs converting to USD. If you convert to USD its locking in the profit in dollars and would be taxable. By converting to USDT you are just converting to another crypto and have not locked in any profit and whatever value you gained at that moment could change at any time. Is my through process on this correct or am I way off and just asking for tax troubles while playing with a potential scam coin?,1527018167
